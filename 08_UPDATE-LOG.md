## April 1, 2026 — Initial Discovery

**Trigger:** Max 20 plan ($200/mo) hit 100% usage in ~70 minutes during normal coding.

**What was done:**
- Analyzed session JSONL (`9100c2d2`): **36.1% avg cache read** (min 21.1%) — should be 90%+
- Analyzed earlier session (`64d42269`): **47.0% avg** (233 entries, min 8.3%) — already degrading
- Downgraded from v2.1.89 to v2.1.68 (npm): cache immediately recovered to **97.6%** (119 entries)
- Confirmed: regression is v2.1.89-specific, not account or server issue
- Set up cc-relay transparent proxy using `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` for per-request monitoring going forward

**Findings:**
- **Bug 1 (Sentinel)** identified — community reverse engineering ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/s/AY2GHQa5Z6)) traced the cause to `cch=00000` sentinel replacement in the standalone binary's embedded Bun fork
- v2.1.89 standalone: 4-17% cache read, never recovers. npm not affected.

**Published:** Nothing yet — data collection phase.

---

## April 2, 2026 — Bugs 3-4 Discovered, Anthropic Responds

**Focus:** Proxy-based testing on v2.1.90 (released this day) + community collaboration.

**What was done:**
- cc-relay v2 proxy operational — logging per-request `cache_creation`, `cache_read`, `status_code`, `latency_ms`
- v2.1.90 benchmark started: npm vs standalone head-to-head on same machine, same proxy
- GrowthBook feature flag extraction confirmed ([@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th)) — `~/.claude.json` contains `cachedGrowthBookFeatures`

**Findings:**
- **Bug 3 (False Rate Limiter)** discovered by [@rwp65](https://github.com/rwp65) in [#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584): client generates synthetic "Rate limit reached" errors (`model: "<synthetic>"`) without calling API. Triggered by large transcripts + concurrent sub-agents.
- **Bug 4 (Microcompact)** discovered by [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th) in [#42542](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42542): three compaction mechanisms silently strip tool results, controlled by server-side GrowthBook A/B flags. Initial hypothesis: cache invalidation.
- **Anthropic response:** Lydia Hallie [posted on X](https://x.com/lydiahallie/status/2039800715607187906): *"Peak-hour limits are tighter and 1M-context sessions got bigger... We fixed a few bugs along the way, but none were over-charging you."*

**Published:** Nothing yet — still testing.

---

## April 3, 2026 — Bug 5 Discovered, v2.1.91 Benchmark, Repo Goes Public

**Focus:** v2.1.91 full benchmark + new bug discovery + comprehensive testing.

**What was done:**
- v2.1.91 released — ran full benchmark: npm vs standalone head-to-head
- Enhanced cc-relay with microcompact detection and budget enforcement scanning
- GrowthBook flag survey across 4 machines / 4 accounts
- Bug 4 cache impact **corrected**: proxy data shows main session cache stays 99%+ during clearing — impact is context quality, not cache invalidation
- Commented on 91+ GitHub issues with analysis cross-references

**Findings:**
- **Bug 5 (Budget Cap)** discovered: `applyToolResultBudget()` enforces 200K aggregate cap via `tengu_hawthorn_window` GrowthBook flag. **261 budget events** measured — tool results truncated to 1-41 chars (April 3 session; full-week max: 49 chars). v2.1.91 `maxResultSizeChars` override is MCP-only, built-in tools unaffected.
- **Bug 8 (JSONL Duplication)** measured: extended thinking generates 2-5 PRELIM entries per API call. Main session: **2.87x** token inflation.
- **v2.1.91 benchmark results:** Sentinel gap closed — npm hit 84.5% cold start; standalone varied by workspace (27.8% in full benchmark, higher in preliminary tests). Cache recovers to 95%+ within a few requests. All bugs except B1-B2 persist.
- **Bug 3 confirmed:** 151 `<synthetic>` entries across 65 sessions on our setup.
- **Bug 4 event count:** 327 microcompact clearing events across the April 3 focused test sessions.

**Published:**
- Repository created: [claude-code-cache-analysis](https://github.com/ArkNill/claude-code-cache-analysis) (now renamed)
- [README.md](README.md), [04_BENCHMARK.md](04_BENCHMARK.md), [05_MICROCOMPACT.md](05_MICROCOMPACT.md), [07_TIMELINE.md](07_TIMELINE.md), [06_TEST-RESULTS-0403.md](06_TEST-RESULTS-0403.md)
- Comments on 91+ GitHub issues

## April 4, 2026 — Rate Limit Header Capture Begins

**Focus:** cc-relay enhancement for rate limit header capture + operational hardening.

**What was done:**
- Enhanced cc-relay to capture `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` response headers → stored in `ratelimit_headers` column (JSON)
- cc-relay streaming hang fix: `client.request()` → `client.send(req, stream=True)` for true streaming proxy
- Added systemd watchdog (60s ping loop, `WatchdogSec=120`, `RestartSec=3`)
- `loginctl enable-linger` for pre-login service start

**Data collected:**
- **2,097 requests with rate limit headers** (first day of capture)
- Headers include: `5h-utilization`, `7d-utilization`, `representative-claim`, `fallback-percentage`, `overage-status`
- First observation: `representative-claim` = `five_hour` in 100% of requests

**Community:**
- [@dancinlife](https://github.com/dancinlife): discovered `organizationUuid`-based quota pooling — accounts under same org share rate limits. Added as contributor.

**Published:** dancinlife contributor addition to repo.

## April 5, 2026 — Data Accumulation, Community Analysis

**Focus:** Continued header data collection + community findings review.

**Data collected:**
- **1,333 additional requests with headers** (total now 3,430+)
- Total proxy DB: 8,794 requests, 1,245 microcompact events, 23,021 budget events. (327 events were from the April 3 focused test sessions; the 1,245 total includes all sessions captured by the proxy since April 1.)

**Community activity:**
- **[@fgrosswig](https://github.com/fgrosswig)** published [64x budget reduction forensics](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/38335#issuecomment-4189537353) in #38335: dual-machine 18-day JSONL analysis. Mar 26: 3.2B tokens no limit → Apr 5: 88M at 90%. Hypothesis: cache-read weight changed from ~0x to ~1x.
- **[@Commandershadow9](https://github.com/Commandershadow9)** published [34-143x capacity reduction](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/41506#issuecomment-4189508296) in #41506: cache fix confirmed, but capacity dropped 34-143x independent of cache bug. Raised thinking token accounting hypothesis.
- **[@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th)**: continued collaboration on #42542 findings.
- **[@marlvinvu](https://github.com/marlvinvu)** in #41346: correlated PRELIM 2-3x inflation with phantom usage reports across multiple issues. Suggested PRELIM + synthetic compound effect.

**Published:** kolkov resume regression reference added to repo.

## April 6, 2026 — Rate Limit Header Analysis, Repo Restructure

**Focus:** Analyze 48h of captured headers + publish findings + repo overhaul.

**Analysis performed:**
- Split 3,702 requests into **8 distinct 5h windows** based on `5h-reset` header timestamps
- Calculated **per-1% utilization cost**: 9K-16K visible output, 1.5M-2.1M cache_read per percentage point
- Identified **thinking token blind spot**: `output_tokens` excludes thinking tokens, visible output explains <50% of observed utilization
- Mapped **7d accumulation pattern**: ratio ~0.12-0.17 relative to 5h peak (6 data points, low precision)
- Established **v2.1.89 separation framework**: golden (Mar 23-27) / bug (Mar 28-Apr 1) / post-fix (Apr 2+) for clean capacity comparison
- Cross-validated against fgrosswig and Commandershadow9 data — consistent with cache-read weighting change and/or thinking token accounting change
- **JSONL session log analysis** (110 main + 279 subagent sessions, April 1-6):
  - 24 synthetic rate limit entries (B3) confirmed in own data
  - PRELIM/FINAL ratio: 0.82x overall, up to 1.14x on heavy days
  - Subagent analysis: 17.3% of cache_read, 40.4% of output, 62% of cache_create
  - Session lifecycle: cache_read grows 24x over 990 turns (25K→595K per turn, +575/turn linear)
  - **Proxy ↔ JSONL cross-correlation: JSONL cache_read is 1.93x of proxy** — directly confirms PRELIM double-counting (B8). Users tracking via JSONL see ~2x inflated numbers.

**Methodology notes:**
- Windows B (peak 0.04) and H (peak 0.02) excluded from per-1% analysis — low activity
- 5h boundaries approximately 5-hour spaced but not perfectly uniform (19:00→01:00 = 6h, 01:00→12:00 = 11h gap during inactive hours)
- Per-1% cache_read variance ~1.35x between windows — workload-dependent
- Plan-specific data (Max 20x/$200) — per-1% costs may differ on other tiers
- 48h / 8 windows is a small sample. Full 7-day cycle completes April 10.

**Comments posted:**
- [#38335](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/38335#issuecomment-4189807108) — proxy data shared with @fgrosswig, complementary analysis (their JSONL + our headers)
- [#41506](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/41506#issuecomment-4189847482) — proxy data shared with @Commandershadow9, methodology notes on their 34x calculation and thinking token hypothesis

**Repo changes:**
- Repository renamed: `claude-code-cache-analysis` → `claude-code-hidden-problem-analysis`
- **RATELIMIT-HEADERS.md** created: full header analysis with per-window data
- **README.md** restructured (653→175 lines): Latest Update at top, investigation timeline, Anthropic counterpoints, document index
- **BUGS.md** created: Bug 1-5, 8 details moved from README
- **QUICKSTART.md** created: setup guide + self-diagnosis moved from README
- **ISSUES.md** created: 91+ issues + community tools + contributors moved from README
- **UPDATE-LOG.md** created: this document

## April 9, 2026 — Community-Wide Fact-Check, 9 New Findings

**Focus:** Systematic collection and verification of all new issues/comments from April 6-9 (500+ new issues, 168 comments on #42796 alone, 110+ comments on 8 core issues). Full fact-check with evidence strength ratings.

**What was done:**
- Collected ALL new issues (500+) and comments across 9 core issues from April 6-9
- Classified each finding by evidence strength: STRONG / MODERATE / WEAK
- Cross-checked claims against independent sources, verified numerical consistency, identified logical gaps and alternative explanations
- Corrected factual error in our own Anthropic response bias analysis (see below)

**New bugs added (STRONG — 5 confirmed):**
- **Bug 8a (JSONL corruption):** Non-atomic writes during concurrent tool execution drop `tool_result` entries → permanent session corruption. 3 independent issues (#45286, #31328, #21321), 10+ duplicates in meta-issue.
- **Bug 9 (/branch inflation):** `/branch` duplicates message history, inflating 6%→73% context in one message. 3 duplicate issues confirm.
- **Bug 10 (TaskOutput thrashing):** Deprecation message causes 21x context injection (87K vs 4K) → triple autocompact → fatal error. JSONL log evidence.
- **Bug 11 (Adaptive thinking zero-reasoning):** bcherny (Anthropic) acknowledged on HN that adaptive thinking can emit zero reasoning → fabrication. Specific examples: stripe API version, git SHA suffix, apt package list. Workaround: `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING=1`.
- **Bug 2a (SendMessage cache miss):** Agent SDK `SendMessage` resume produces complete cache miss (`cache_read=0`) including system prompt. Different from CLI resume bug. cnighswonger independently confirmed.

**Preliminary findings added (MODERATE — 4 conditional):**
- **P1/P2 (Cache TTL dual tiers):** Two triggers for 1h→5m TTL downgrade — (A) `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` (Anthropic `has repro`, n=1) and (B) quota 100% crossing (cnighswonger interceptor data). Likely one server-side mechanism with multiple disqualifying conditions.
- **P3 (Output efficiency prompt):** v2.1.64 (Mar 3) added "Try the simplest approach first" to system prompt. Confirmed via [Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts). Likely aggravating factor, not sole cause.
- **P4 (Third-party detection gap):** Raw SDK calls with OAuth bill to plan instead of extra usage. HTTP header evidence. 42+ misclassification issues.

**Key quantitative data from community (with caveats):**
- **@wpank**: 47,810 requests, $10,700 spend. v2.1.63 vs v2.1.96 = 3.3x cost. *Caveat: unequal session durations (5.15h vs 76min) inflate headline number.*
- **@cnighswonger**: 4,700 calls, 98.3% cache hit with interceptor. 52-73% of calls needed block relocation, 98% had non-deterministic tool ordering. *Caveat: no controlled before/after baseline.*
- **v2.1.63 downgrade**: 4 independent confirmations of improvement. *Caveat: breno-ribeiro706 notes "still faster than a month ago" — server-side issues persist regardless of CLI version.*

**Anthropic response (April 6-9):**
- **bcherny**: 6 comments on #42796 (April 6 only), then complete silence April 7-8
- Acknowledged: thinking redaction = UI-only, adaptive thinking medium=85 default, duplicate-recording bug fix
- Did NOT address: system prompt change, v2.1.63 downgrade data, billing routing bug
- **HN (separate)**: bcherny acknowledged adaptive thinking zero-reasoning bug, model team investigating
- **All other issues (#38335, #41930, #42542, etc.):** 0 Anthropic responses

**★ Correction — Anthropic response bias:**
Previous analysis stated bcherny responded "to" stellaraccident (AMD director) within 4 hours. **Fact-check found this is incorrect.** bcherny's first response (Apr 6, 17:55 UTC) came **5 hours before** stellaraccident's first comment (Apr 6, 22:54 UTC). The trigger was HN virality (58 comments/day spike), not corporate affiliation. The actual bias is toward **visibility/virality**, not toward specific individuals. The broader silence pattern remains real: #38335 (478 comments, 15 days, 0 responses), #41930 (49 comments, 8+ days, 0 responses).

**New community tools & repos:**
- [claude-code-cache-fix](https://github.com/cnighswonger/claude-code-cache-fix) — `NODE_OPTIONS` fetch interceptor fixing block position + tool ordering + image carry-forward (by [@cnighswonger](https://github.com/cnighswonger))
- [cc-trace](https://github.com/alexfazio/cc-trace) — mitmproxy-based CC API interception + analysis (★152) (by [@alexfazio](https://github.com/alexfazio))
- [X-Ray-Claude-Code-Interceptor](https://github.com/Renvect/X-Ray-Claude-Code-Interceptor) — Node.js proxy with payload analysis + smart stripping (by [@Renvect](https://github.com/Renvect))
- [claude-code-system-prompts](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts) — Version-tracked CC system prompt diffs (by Piebald-AI)
- [openwolf](https://github.com/cytostack/openwolf) — Token usage stabilization (by cytostack)

**Published:** Bug updates to 01_BUGS.md, 07_TIMELINE.md, 08_UPDATE-LOG.md, 10_ISSUES.md.

### Changelog Cross-Reference (v2.1.92–v2.1.97)

**Focus:** Systematic cross-reference of [official changelog](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) against all 9 unfixed bugs + 4 preliminary findings.

**What was done:**
- Reviewed complete changelog entries for v2.1.92, v2.1.94, v2.1.96, and v2.1.97 (v2.1.93 and v2.1.95 do not exist — skipped versions)
- Mapped every fix/feature against Bug Matrix (B3–B11, B2a, P1–P4)
- Identified false positives: v2.1.94 "429 rate-limit handling" and v2.1.97 "exponential backoff" fix **server 429 response** handling, not B3's **client-side synthetic** rate limiter (different code path). v2.1.92 "Write tool diff 60% faster" is diff computation speed, not B5 budget enforcement.

**Findings:**
- **0 of 9 unfixed bugs addressed** across 6 releases (8 days of development)
- **B11 symptoms reduced** (v2.1.94 effort default medium→high, v2.1.92 whitespace-only thinking crash fix) — root cause "investigating" per bcherny with no follow-up
- **B8 possibly partial** — v2.1.92 transcript accuracy fix may affect PRELIM duplication, but JSONL file-level verification needed
- **P3 confirmed still active** — "Output Efficiency" system prompt section (added v2.1.64, Mar 3) present verbatim in v2.1.97 system prompt, unchanged through 33 releases
- **B10 arguably worsened** — TaskOutput deprecation message more prominently embedded in v2.1.97 system prompt
- Development priorities in v2.1.92–97: Bedrock wizard, Cedar syntax highlighting, focus view toggle, `/tag` removal, footer layout, MCP buffer fixes, OAuth improvements — UI/infrastructure polish, not core accounting or context integrity

**Published:** New section added to [01_BUGS.md — Changelog Cross-Reference](01_BUGS.md#changelog-cross-reference-v2192v2197), README.md status/environment updated to reflect v2.1.97 verification.

---

## Planned (as of April 9)

The following items were identified during the April 1-9 analysis cycle and remain pending:

- Continue rate limit header data collection through April 10 (7d window reset)
- **Thinking token isolation test**: run sessions with `alwaysThinkingEnabled: false` and compare per-1% utilization cost. If it drops significantly → thinking tokens are the main driver. If not → cache-read weighting is primary.
- Publish full 7-day cycle analysis with per-window utilization tracking
- Monitor community responses to #38335 and #41506 comments
- **Verify preliminary findings (P1/P2, P3, P4):** P1/P2 cache TTL dual tiers (has repro for telemetry trigger, needs n>1; quota trigger needs direct observation), P3 "Output efficiency" prompt (needs causal attribution), P4 third-party detection (needs source code confirmation)
- **v2.1.92+ JSONL verification:** Check if B8 PRELIM duplication is reduced in transcript (changelog: "per-block entries carry final token usage")

---

*This log is updated with each significant investigation activity. See [07_TIMELINE.md](07_TIMELINE.md) for the broader 14-month history of the rate limit crisis.*
