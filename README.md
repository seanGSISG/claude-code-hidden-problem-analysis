## Current Status: v2.1.90 — Cache Fixed, But Not Fully Resolved

**v2.1.90 fixed the client-side cache regression** (Bug 1 + Bug 2), restoring **86%+ overall cache read ratio** and **95-99% in stable sessions**. However, **multiple users on v2.1.90 still report rapid drain**, pointing to additional bugs beyond the cache layer.

| Version | Installation | Cache Read (stable) | Sub-agent Cold Start | Verdict |
|---------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|
| **v2.1.90** | **npm (Node.js)** | **95-99.8%** | **79-87%** | **Best available** |
| **v2.1.90** | **Standalone (ELF)** | **95-99.7%** | **47-67%** (recovers to 94-99%) | **Good** |
| v2.1.89 | Standalone (ELF) | 90-99% | **4-17%** (never recovers) | **Avoid** |
| v2.1.68 | npm | Normal | Normal | Safe but outdated |

**Update to v2.1.90 if you haven't already** — it fixes the biggest drain source. But be aware that at least **three additional bugs** remain unfixed (see [Root Cause](#root-cause) section):

- **Bug 3:** Client-side false rate limiter generates fake "Rate limit reached" errors without calling the API ([#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584))
- **Bug 4:** Silent microcompact invalidates prompt cache by stripping tool results mid-session ([#42542](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42542))
- **Server-side:** 1M context requests incorrectly classified as "extra usage" on Max plans ([#42616](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42616), [#42569](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42569))

### What to Do Right Now

1. **Disable auto-update** — pin v2.1.90 until Anthropic confirms a full fix
2. **Update to v2.1.90** if you haven't already
3. **Avoid `--resume`** — still causes full context replay regardless of version
4. **Monitor cache** with a transparent proxy if you want to verify

```jsonc
// ~/.claude/settings.json — disable auto-update
{
  "env": {
    "DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER": "1"
  }
}
```

## npm vs Standalone Binary — Which Should I Use?

Claude Code ships in two forms. The choice matters for cache efficiency:

### Standalone Binary (ELF)

- Installed via `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`
- Ships as a **single ELF 64-bit executable** (~228MB) with embedded Bun runtime
- Contains the Sentinel replacement mechanism (`cch=00000`) that can corrupt cache prefixes
- **v2.1.90 status:** Sentinel bug **partially mitigated** — cold starts still lag but cache recovers quickly

### npm Package (Node.js)

- Installed via `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Ships as a **bundled JavaScript file** (`cli.js`, ~13MB) executed by Node.js
- **Does not contain** the Sentinel replacement logic — immune to Bug 1
- Dependencies are bundled inline (zero external npm packages at runtime, no supply chain risk)

### Head-to-Head Benchmark (v2.1.90, same machine, same proxy)

| Metric | npm | Standalone | Winner |
|--------|-----|-----------|--------|
| Overall cache read % | 86.4% | 86.2% | Tie |
| Stable session | 95-99.8% | 95-99.7% | Tie |
| Sub-agent cold start | 79-87% | 47-67% | npm |
| Sub-agent warmed (5+ req) | 87-94% | 94-99% | Tie |
| Usage for full test suite | 7% of Max 20 | 5% of Max 20 | Tie |

**Bottom line:** npm is marginally better for sub-agent-heavy workflows. For everything else, they're equivalent on v2.1.90. See **[BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md)** for raw data and methodology.

### Coexistence Setup

Both can coexist on the same machine at different paths:

```bash
# npm install (does NOT affect standalone binary)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Check what you have
file $(which claude)
# ELF 64-bit = standalone binary
# symbolic link to .../cli.js = npm

# If both are installed, use aliases to pick:
alias claude-npm="ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 /path/to/npm/claude"
alias claude-bin="ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 /path/to/standalone/claude"
```

## Root Cause

Four client-side bugs (two cache, one rate limiter, one compaction) plus server-side accounting issues. The first two were identified through community reverse engineering ([Reddit analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/s/AY2GHQa5Z6)); the latter two discovered April 2-3, 2026:

### Bug 1 — Sentinel Replacement (standalone binary only)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#40524](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40524)

The standalone binary's embedded Bun fork contains a `cch=00000` sentinel replacement mechanism. Under certain conditions, the sentinel in `messages` gets incorrectly substituted — breaking the cache prefix and forcing a full rebuild.

- **v2.1.89:** Catastrophic — cache read drops to 4-17%, never recovers
- **v2.1.90:** Partially mitigated — cold start still affected (47-67%), but recovers to 94-99% after warming
- **npm:** Not affected — the JavaScript bundle does not contain this logic

**Official fix in v2.1.89-90 ([changelog](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog)):**
- v2.1.89: *"Fixed prompt cache misses in long sessions caused by tool schema bytes changing mid-session"*
- v2.1.90: *"Improved performance: eliminated per-turn JSON.stringify of MCP tool schemas on cache-key lookup"*

### Bug 2 — Resume Cache Breakage (v2.1.69+)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#34629](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/34629)

`deferred_tools_delta` (introduced in v2.1.69) causes the first message's structure on `--resume` to not match the server's cached version — resulting in a complete cache miss. On a 500K token conversation, a single resume costs ~$0.15 in quota.

**Official fix in v2.1.90 ([changelog](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog)):**
> *"Fixed --resume causing a full prompt-cache miss on the first request for users with deferred tools, MCP servers, or custom agents (regression since v2.1.69)"*

**Note:** While the changelog states this is fixed, community reports (e.g., `claude -p --resume` in headless harness mode) suggest edge cases may remain. We recommend continuing to avoid `--resume` until fully verified.

### Bug 3 — Client-Side False Rate Limiter (all versions)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584)

The local rate limiter generates **synthetic "Rate limit reached" errors** without ever calling the Anthropic API. These errors are identifiable in session logs by:

```json
{
  "model": "<synthetic>",
  "usage": { "input_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 0 }
}
```

Triggered by **large transcripts (~74MB+)** and **concurrent sub-agent spawns**. The rate limiter multiplies `context_size × concurrent_requests`, so multi-agent workflows get blocked even when each individual request is small.

- **Discovery:** [@rwp65](https://github.com/rwp65) in [#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584) (March 29, 2026)
- **Cross-referenced by:** [@marlvinvu](https://github.com/marlvinvu) across [#40438](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40438), [#39938](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/39938), [#38239](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/38239)
- **Status:** **Unfixed** — present in all versions including v2.1.90
- **Impact:** Users see "Rate limit reached" immediately, even after hours of inactivity when the budget should have fully reset. No API call is made, so the error is entirely client-generated.

### Bug 4 — Silent Microcompact → Cache Invalidation (v2.1.89+)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#42542](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42542)

Three compaction mechanisms in `src/services/compact/` run **silently on every API call**, stripping old tool results without user notification. This invalidates prompt cache prefixes, causing subsequent API calls to be billed at full price.

| Mechanism | Source | Trigger | Control |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Time-based microcompact** | `microCompact.ts:422` | Gap since last assistant message exceeds threshold | GrowthBook: `getTimeBasedMCConfig()` |
| **Cached microcompact** | `microCompact.ts:305` | Count-based trigger, uses `cache_edits` API to delete old tool results | GrowthBook: `getCachedMCConfig()` |
| **Session memory compact** | `sessionMemoryCompact.ts:57` | Runs before autocompact | GrowthBook flag |

**Key findings:**
- All three bypass `DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT` and `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE`
- Controlled by **server-side GrowthBook A/B testing flags** — Anthropic can change behavior without a client update
- Tool results silently replaced with `[Old tool result content cleared]` — no compaction notification shown
- This explains why v2.1.90 fixes cache for some users but not others (depends on GrowthBook flag assignment)
- Also explains why old Docker versions that were never updated started draining recently ([#37394](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/37394)) — server-side flags changed

**Cache invalidation chain:**
1. Microcompact triggers silently (GrowthBook flag)
2. Old tool results stripped → conversation prefix changes
3. Prompt cache prefix no longer matches → cache miss
4. Next API call: 0% cache read → full-price billing on entire context
5. Usage burns 5-10x faster than expected

- **Update (April 3):** GrowthBook flag survey across 4 machines / 4 accounts shows **all gates disabled** — yet context is still being stripped. See [MICROCOMPACT.md](MICROCOMPACT.md) for full analysis, collected flag data, and open questions (runtime vs disk cache divergence, server-side clearing hypothesis).
- **Discovery:** [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th) in [#42542](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42542) (April 2, 2026)
- **Status:** **Unfixed** — present in v2.1.89+ and controlled server-side. All known GrowthBook gates show disabled but stripping continues.

## Measured Data

### Methodology

Transparent local monitoring proxy using [`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings#environment-variables) (official environment variable). The proxy logs `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` from each API response without modifying requests or responses (source-audited).

### v2.1.89 Standalone — Before Fix (Broken)

| Session | Turns | Cache Read Ratio | Status |
|---------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Session A | 168 | **4.3%** | poor — 20x cost inflation |
| Session B | 89 | **22.6%** | poor |
| Session C | 233 | **34.6%** | poor |

### v2.1.90 — After Fix (Both Installations)

| Metric | npm (Node.js) | Standalone (ELF) |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Scenarios completed | 7 (incl. 79-report parallel agent read) | 4 (forge, browsegrab, feedkit 5-turn, 3-project parallel) |
| Usage consumed | 28% → 35% (**7%**) | 35% → 40% (**5%**) |
| Overall cache read | **86.4%** | **86.2%** |
| Stable session read | **95-99.8%** | **95-99.7%** |

Full per-request data and warming curves: **[BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md)**

### Version Comparison Summary

| Metric | v2.1.89 Standalone | v2.1.90 Standalone | v2.1.90 npm |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Sub-agent cold start | **4-17%** (never recovers) | **47-67%** (recovers to 94-99%) | **79-87%** |
| Stable session | 90-99% | **95-99.7%** | **95-99.8%** |
| Usage for test suite | 100% in ~70 min | **5%** | **7%** |
| Verdict | **Avoid** | **Good** | **Optimal** |

## Usage Precautions

### Behaviors to Avoid

| Behavior | Why | Measured Impact |
|----------|-----|-----------------|
| `--resume` | Replays entire conversation history as billable input including opaque thinking block signatures | 500K+ tokens per resume ([#42260](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42260)) |
| `/dream`, `/insights` | Background API calls consume tokens without visible output | Silent drain ([#40438](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40438)) |
| v2.1.89 or earlier standalone | Sentinel bug causes sustained 4-17% cache read | 3-4x token waste, never recovers |
| Enabling auto-update | Future versions may reintroduce regressions | Pin v2.1.90 until official fix confirmed |

### Behaviors to Use with Caution

| Behavior | Why | Recommendation |
|----------|-----|----------------|
| Parallel sub-agents (single terminal) | Each agent starts with fresh context, but warms up and shares billing context | **Safe** — agents warm up within 1-2 requests |
| Multiple terminals simultaneously | Each terminal is a fully independent session — no cache sharing, parallel quota drain | **Limit to one active terminal** |
| Large CLAUDE.md / context files | Sent on every turn — with broken cache, billed at full price each time | Keep lean; less critical on v2.1.90 with working cache |
| Session start / compaction | `cache_creation` spikes are structural and unavoidable | Normal — budget for it |

### Server-Side Factors (Unresolved)

Even with cache working perfectly (91-99%), multiple users report faster quota drain compared to 2-3 weeks ago. At least three server-side issues contribute:

**1. Server-side accounting change:** Old Docker versions (v2.1.74, v2.1.86 — never updated) started draining fast recently, proving the issue isn't purely client-side ([#37394](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/37394), reported by [@pablofuenzalidadf](https://github.com/pablofuenzalidadf)).

**2. 1M context billing regression:** Max plans include 1M context free (announced March 13, confirmed March 20), but a late-March regression causes the server to incorrectly classify these requests as "extra usage." Debug logs show a 429 error at only ~23K tokens with `"Extra usage is required for long context requests"` on a Max plan with 1M context enabled ([#42616](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42616), request ID: `req_011CZf8TJf84hAUziB6LuRoc`). Related display bug: [#42569](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42569).

**3. Org-level quota sharing:** Accounts on the same billing method share rate limit pools ([#41881](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/41881)). Source code confirms `passesEligibilityCache` and `overageCreditGrantCache` are keyed by `organizationUuid`, not `accountUuid`.

## Quick Setup Guide

### For New Users

```bash
# 1. Install via npm (recommended — no Sentinel bug)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# 2. Disable auto-update
cat > ~/.claude/settings.json << 'EOF'
{
  "env": {
    "DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER": "1"
  }
}
EOF

# 3. Verify
claude --version   # should show 2.1.90
file $(which claude)   # should show symbolic link to cli.js
```

### For Existing Standalone Users

```bash
# 1. Update to v2.1.90
claude update

# 2. Disable auto-update (add to existing settings.json)
# Add "DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER": "1" to the "env" section

# 3. Verify
claude --version   # should show 2.1.90
```

### Optional: Monitor Cache Efficiency

Set up a transparent proxy using `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to log cache metrics:

```bash
# Route through local proxy for monitoring
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 claude

# Parse cache_creation_input_tokens / cache_read_input_tokens from responses
# Healthy: read ratio > 80%  |  Affected: read ratio < 40%
```

---

## How to Check If You're Affected

The session JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/` contain usage data for each turn:

- **Healthy session:** `cache_read` >> `cache_creation` (read ratio > 80%)
- **Affected session:** `cache_creation` >> `cache_read` (read ratio < 40%)

If most sessions show low read ratios, you're likely on an affected version. Update to v2.1.90.
