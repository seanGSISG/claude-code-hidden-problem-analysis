# Claude Code Hidden Problem Analysis

> **TL;DR:** Claude Code has **11 confirmed client-side bugs** (B1-B5, B8, B8a, B9, B10, B11, B2a) plus **4 preliminary findings** (P1-P4). Cache bugs (B1-B2) are fixed in v2.1.91. **Nine remain unfixed as of v2.1.97** (latest). Six releases (v2.1.92–97) shipped zero fixes for token accounting, context mutation, or log integrity bugs. Additionally, proxy-captured rate limit headers reveal a **dual 5h/7d window quota system** with a significant **thinking token blind spot**. Anthropic acknowledged B11 (adaptive thinking zero-reasoning) on HN but has not followed up.
>
> **Last updated:** April 9, 2026 — Changelog cross-reference (v2.1.92–97) confirms no unfixed bug was addressed across 6 releases. See [01_BUGS.md — Changelog Cross-Reference](01_BUGS.md#changelog-cross-reference-v2192v2197) and [08_UPDATE-LOG.md](08_UPDATE-LOG.md).

## Latest Update (April 9)

### April 9 — 5 new bugs, 4 preliminary findings, changelog cross-reference

**5 new bugs + 4 preliminary findings** from community-wide issue/comment analysis and fact-checking (April 6-9):

| Bug | What | Evidence | Details |
|-----|------|----------|---------|
| **B8a** | JSONL non-atomic write → session corruption | ~10+ duplicates in [#21321](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21321) | [01_BUGS.md](01_BUGS.md#bug-8a--jsonl-non-atomic-write-corruption-v2185) |
| **B9** | `/branch` context inflation (6%→73%) | 3 duplicate issues | [01_BUGS.md](01_BUGS.md#bug-9--branch-context-inflation-all-versions) |
| **B10** | TaskOutput deprecation → 21x context injection → fatal | `has repro` | [01_BUGS.md](01_BUGS.md#bug-10--taskoutput-deprecation--autocompact-thrashing-v2192) |
| **B11** | Adaptive thinking zero-reasoning → fabrication | **Anthropic acknowledged (HN)** | [01_BUGS.md](01_BUGS.md#bug-11--adaptive-thinking-zero-reasoning-server-side-acknowledged) |
| **B2a** | SendMessage resume: cache_read=0 (even system prompt) | cnighswonger confirmed | [01_BUGS.md](01_BUGS.md#bug-2a--sendmessage-resume-cache-miss-agent-sdk) |

**Preliminary findings (MODERATE):** P1/P2 cache TTL dual tiers — two triggers for 1h→5m downgrade: telemetry disabled (`has repro`) and quota exceeded. P3 "Output efficiency" system prompt (v2.1.64). P4 third-party detection gap. See [01_BUGS.md — Preliminary Findings](01_BUGS.md#preliminary-findings-april-9-moderate--conditional-inclusion).

**Changelog cross-reference (v2.1.92–v2.1.97):** Six releases shipped zero fixes for the nine unfixed bugs. See [01_BUGS.md — Changelog Cross-Reference](01_BUGS.md#changelog-cross-reference-v2192v2197).

### April 8 — Full-week proxy dataset — [13_PROXY-DATA.md](13_PROXY-DATA.md)

cc-relay proxy database now covers **17,610 requests** across **129 sessions** (April 1-8), with automated bug detection across **532 JSONL files** (158.3 MB):

| Metric | Previous (Apr 3) | Current (Apr 1-8) | Change |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|--------|
| Budget enforcement (B5) | 261 events | **72,839 events** | 279x |
| Microcompact (B4) | 327 events | **3,782 events** (15,998 items) | 12x |
| B8 inflation (bulk scan) | 2.87x (1 session) | **2.37x avg** (10 sessions, max 4.42x) | Universal |
| Synthetic rate limit (B3) | 24 entries / 6 days | **183/532 files** (34.4%) with `<synthetic>` model entries | Pervasive |
| Context growth rate | +575 tok/turn | **median 1,845 tok/min** (53 sessions) | Statistical |

**New findings:**
- **Request rate:** Mean 2.72 req/min across 78 sessions. Sustained max 8.04 req/min (60+ min sessions). Two very short sessions (2-3 min) averaged 12+ req/min; burst peak 86 req/60s from subagent fan-out.
- **Per-request cost scales with session length:** 0-30min: $0.20/req → 5hr+: $0.33/req (structural, not version-specific)
- **Cache efficiency stable:** 98-99% across all session lengths on v2.1.91 (Bugs 1-2 fully fixed)
- **Subagent gap:** Haiku 58.1% cache vs Opus 98.8% — 40pp gap persists
- **Microcompact intensifies:** 1.6 items/event at <10 messages → 6.6 items/event at 200+ messages

### Rate limit header analysis — [02_RATELIMIT-HEADERS.md](02_RATELIMIT-HEADERS.md)

Transparent proxy (cc-relay) captured `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` headers across **3,702 requests** (April 4-6), revealing the server-side quota architecture:

**Dual sliding window system:**
- Two independent counters: **5-hour** (`5h-utilization`) and **7-day** (`7d-utilization`)
- `representative-claim` = `five_hour` in **100%** of requests — the 5h window is always the bottleneck
- 5h windows reset on roughly 5-hour intervals; 7d resets weekly (April 10, 12:00 KST for this account)

**Per-1% utilization cost** (measured across 5 active windows on Max 20x / $200/mo):

| Metric | Range | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| Output per 1% | 9K-16K | Visible output only (thinking excluded) |
| Cache Read per 1% | 1.5M-2.1M | 96-99% of visible token volume |
| Total Visible per 1% | 1.5M-2.1M | Output + Cache Read + Input |
| 7d accumulation ratio | 0.12-0.17 | 7d_delta relative to 5h_peak |

**Thinking token blind spot:** Extended thinking tokens are **not included** in the `output_tokens` field from the API. At 9K-16K visible output per 1%, a full 5h window (100%) = only 0.9M-1.6M visible output tokens — low for several hours of Opus work. The gap is consistent with thinking tokens being counted against the quota, but the exact mechanism can't be confirmed from the client side. Thinking-disabled isolation test planned for the week of April 6.

**Community cross-validation:**
- [@fgrosswig](https://github.com/fgrosswig): [64x budget reduction](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/38335#issuecomment-4189537353) — dual-machine 18-day JSONL forensics (Mar 26: 3.2B tokens no limit → Apr 5: 88M at 90%)
- [@Commandershadow9](https://github.com/Commandershadow9): [34-143x capacity reduction](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/41506#issuecomment-4189508296) — cache fix confirmed, capacity drop independent of cache bug, thinking token hypothesis

**v2.1.89 separation:** The cache regression (Mar 28 - Apr 1) is a separate, resolved issue. The capacity reduction exists independently — clean comparison: golden period (Mar 23-27, cache 98-99%) vs post-fix (Apr 2+, cache 84-97%), both with healthy cache. Data collection ongoing through April 10 (full 7d cycle).

### What You Can Do

1. **Update to v2.1.91+** — fixes the cache regression (worst drain). v2.1.92–97 add no bug fixes for issues tracked here but are safe to use
2. **npm or standalone — both fine on v2.1.91** (Sentinel gap closed)
3. **Don't use `--resume` or `--continue`** — replays full context as billable input
4. **Start fresh sessions periodically** — the 200K tool result cap (B5) silently truncates older results
5. **Avoid `/dream` and `/insights`** — background API calls that drain silently

See [09_QUICKSTART.md](09_QUICKSTART.md) for setup guide and self-diagnosis. Full proxy dataset: **[13_PROXY-DATA.md](13_PROXY-DATA.md)**.

## Server-Side Factors (Unresolved)

Even with cache at 95-99%, drain persists. At least four server-side issues contribute:

**1. Server-side accounting change:** Old Docker versions (v2.1.74, v2.1.86 — never updated) started draining fast recently, proving the issue isn't purely client-side ([#37394](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/37394)).

**2. 1M context billing regression:** A late-March regression causes the server to incorrectly classify Max plan 1M context requests as "extra usage." Debug logs show a 429 error at only ~23K tokens ([#42616](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42616)).

**3. Dual-window quota + thinking token blind spot:** 5h + 7d independent windows. Visible output only 9K-16K per 1% — the gap is likely thinking tokens counted against quota but invisible to clients. Full analysis: [02_RATELIMIT-HEADERS.md](02_RATELIMIT-HEADERS.md).

**4. Org-level quota sharing:** Accounts under the same organization share rate limit pools. `passesEligibilityCache` and `overageCreditGrantCache` are keyed by `organizationUuid`, not `accountUuid`. Originally discovered by [@dancinlife](https://github.com/dancinlife) through client-side analysis of the obfuscated JavaScript bundle.

## Background

### How this started

On April 1, 2026, my Max 20 plan ($200/mo) hit 100% usage in ~70 minutes during normal coding. JSONL analysis showed the session averaging **36.1% cache read** (min 21.1%) where it should have been 90%+. Every token was being billed at full price.

Downgrading from v2.1.89 to v2.1.68 immediately recovered cache to **97.6%** — confirming the regression was version-specific. I set up a transparent monitoring proxy (cc-relay) to capture per-request data going forward.

What started as personal debugging quickly expanded. Dozens of users were reporting the same symptoms across what became [91+ GitHub issues](10_ISSUES.md). Community members — [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th), [@rwp65](https://github.com/rwp65), [@fgrosswig](https://github.com/fgrosswig), [@Commandershadow9](https://github.com/Commandershadow9), and [12 others](10_ISSUES.md#contributors--acknowledgments) — independently found different pieces of the puzzle.

### Anthropic's Position (April 2)

Lydia Hallie (Anthropic, Product) [posted on X](https://x.com/lydiahallie/status/2039800715607187906):

> *"Peak-hour limits are tighter and 1M-context sessions got bigger, that's most of what you're feeling. We fixed a few bugs along the way, but none were over-charging you."*

She [recommended](https://x.com/lydiahallie/status/2039800718371307603) using Sonnet as default, lowering effort level, starting fresh instead of resuming, and capping context with `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=200000`.

**Where our data diverges from this assessment:**

- **"None were over-charging you"** — Bug 5 silently truncates tool results to 1-49 chars after a 200K aggregate threshold. Users paying for 1M context effectively have a 200K tool result budget for built-in tools. 261 truncation events measured in a single session.
- **"We fixed a few bugs"** — Cache bugs (B1-B2) are fixed, but Bugs 3-5 and B8 remain active in v2.1.91. Client-side false rate limiter (B3) generated 151 synthetic "Rate limit reached" errors across 65 sessions on our setup — zero API calls made.
- **"Peak-hour limits are tighter"** — Our April 6 proxy data shows the bottleneck is always the 5h window (`representative-claim` = `five_hour` in 100% of 3,702 requests), regardless of time of day. Weekend and off-peak data shows the same pattern.
- **Thinking token accounting** — Extended thinking tokens don't appear in `output_tokens` from the API, yet visible output alone explains less than half the observed utilization cost. If thinking tokens are counted against quota at output-token rate, this is a significant invisible cost that users have no way to monitor or control.

**GitHub response:** bcherny posted 6 comments on [#42796](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42796) (April 6 only, triggered by HN virality), then went silent. Zero responses on all other 90+ issues including #38335 (478 comments, 15 days). See [10_ISSUES.md](10_ISSUES.md#anthropic-official-response) for full history.

### Cache TTL (not a bug)

[@luongnv89](https://github.com/luongnv89) [documented](https://github.com/luongnv89/cc-context-stats/blob/main/context-stats-cache-misses.md) that idle gaps of 13+ hours cause a full cache rebuild. Anthropic documents a 5-minute TTL, though our data shows 5-26 minute gaps sometimes maintaining 96%+ cache — the actual TTL may be longer in practice. Not a bug, but worth knowing about.
