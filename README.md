# Claude Code Rate Limit Crisis — Root Cause Analysis

> **TL;DR:** Claude Code has **7 confirmed bugs across 5 layers** that drain usage faster than expected. The cache bugs (1-2) are fixed in v2.1.91. Five others — silent tool result truncation, false rate limiting, context stripping, log inflation, and server-side changes — remain unfixed as of v2.1.91 (April 3, 2026). All findings below are backed by proxy-measured data from controlled tests.

This repo documents the investigation, from the initial 70-minute drain on a $200/mo Max plan to a systematic 6-layer bug model tested across v2.1.89 through v2.1.91. The analysis is independent and community-driven — Anthropic has not responded on any of the 91+ related GitHub issues.

> **Last updated:** April 3, 2026 — v2.1.91 tested, [CHANGELOG.md ref](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## Background

On April 1, 2026, my Max 20 plan ($200/mo) hit 100% usage in ~70 minutes during normal coding. JSONL analysis showed the affected session averaging **36.1% cache read** (min 21.1%) where it should have been 90%+ — every token billed at full price. An earlier session that day had already degraded to **47.0% average** (233 entries, min 8.3%).

Immediate workaround was downgrading from v2.1.89 to v2.1.68 (npm, pre-regression baseline). Cache immediately recovered to **97.6% average** (119 entries) on the downgraded version — confirming the regression was v2.1.89-specific. I then set up a transparent monitoring proxy (cc-relay) using the official `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env var to capture per-request data going forward.

What began as a personal debugging session turned into a broader investigation as dozens of other users reported the same issue across [91+ GitHub issues](#related-issues). The community — [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th), [@rwp65](https://github.com/rwp65), [@dbrunet73](https://github.com/dbrunet73), [@luongnv89](https://github.com/luongnv89), and [12 others](#contributors--acknowledgments) — independently found different pieces of the puzzle.

This repo consolidates those findings into a structured analysis with measured data.

### Anthropic's Position (April 2)

Lydia Hallie (Anthropic) [posted on X](https://x.com/lydiahallie/status/2039800715607187906):

> *"Peak-hour limits are tighter and 1M-context sessions got bigger, that's most of what you're feeling. We fixed a few bugs along the way, but none were over-charging you."*

She [recommended](https://x.com/lydiahallie/status/2039800718371307603) using Sonnet as default, lowering effort level, starting fresh instead of resuming, and capping context with `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=200000`.

Our measured data agrees that the cache bugs are fixed, but identifies five additional mechanisms that Anthropic's statement doesn't address — see the [bug table below](#whats-happening-april-3-2026).

### Cache TTL (not a bug)

Separately, [@luongnv89](https://github.com/luongnv89) [documented](https://github.com/luongnv89/cc-context-stats/blob/main/context-stats-cache-misses.md) that idle gaps of 13+ hours cause a full 350K-token cache rebuild when resuming (cache write costs $3.75/M vs read at $0.30/M — a 12.5x difference). Our data shows shorter gaps (5-26 minutes) maintain 96%+ cache, so this only affects long idle periods. It's by design (5-minute TTL), not a bug — but worth knowing about.

### What Changed in v2.1.91 ([full changelog](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md))

The most relevant v2.1.91 changes for this analysis:
- `_meta["anthropic/maxResultSizeChars"]` annotation (up to 500K) — MCP tool results can now opt out of truncation. **Built-in tools are NOT affected.**
- `--resume` transcript chain break fix — additional stability for session resumption
- `Edit` tool uses shorter `old_string` anchors — reduces output tokens
- `stripAnsi` routed through `Bun.stripANSI` — performance improvement that appears to have closed the Sentinel gap between npm and standalone

---

## What's Happening (April 3, 2026)

The original cache regression (v2.1.89 standalone draining 100% in 70 minutes) is **fixed** in v2.1.90-91. Cache read ratios are back to 95-99% in stable sessions, and npm/standalone now perform identically on v2.1.91.

But cache was only part of the story. Proxy-based testing revealed five additional mechanisms that remain active:

| Bug | What It Does | Impact | Status (v2.1.91) | Evidence |
|-----|-------------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **B1** Sentinel | Standalone binary corrupts cache prefix | 4-17% cache read (v2.1.89) | **Fixed** — npm=standalone now | [BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md) |
| **B2** Resume | `--resume` replays full context uncached | 20x cost per resume | **Fixed** (avoid `--resume` anyway) | [#34629](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/34629) |
| **B3** False RL | Client blocks API calls with fake error | Instant "Rate limit reached", 0 API calls | **Unfixed** — 151 entries / 65 sessions | [#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584) |
| **B4** Microcompact | Tool results silently cleared mid-session | Context quality degrades (cache unaffected) | **Unfixed** — 327 events detected | [#42542](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42542) |
| **B5** Budget cap | 200K aggregate limit on tool results | Older results truncated to 1-41 chars | **Unfixed** (MCP override only) | [MICROCOMPACT.md](MICROCOMPACT.md) |
| **B8** Log inflation | Extended thinking duplicates JSONL entries | 2.87x local token inflation | **Unfixed** | [#41346](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/41346) |
| **Server** | Peak-hour limits tightened + 1M billing bug | Reduced effective quota | **By design** (Anthropic confirmed) | [#42616](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42616) |

### What You Can Do

1. **Update to v2.1.91** — this fixes the cache regression that caused the worst drain
2. **npm or standalone — either is fine on v2.1.91** (Sentinel gap closed, [84.7% identical cold start](#measured-data))
3. **Don't use `--resume` or `--continue`** — replays full context as billable input
4. **Start fresh sessions periodically** — the 200K tool result cap (B5) means older file reads get silently truncated after ~15-20 tool uses
5. **Avoid `/dream` and `/insights`** — background API calls that drain silently

```jsonc
// ~/.claude/settings.json — disable auto-update
{
  "env": {
    "DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER": "1"
  }
}
```

## npm vs Standalone Binary

**Short answer: on v2.1.91, it doesn't matter.** Both achieve identical 84.7% cold-start cache read and 97-99% in stable sessions. The Sentinel gap that existed in v2.1.90 (47-67% vs 79-87% on sub-agent cold starts) has been closed.

If you want the details, Claude Code ships in two forms:

### Standalone Binary (ELF)

- Installed via `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`
- Ships as a **single ELF 64-bit executable** (~228MB) with embedded Bun runtime
- Contains the Sentinel replacement mechanism (`cch=00000`) that can corrupt cache prefixes
- **v2.1.91 status:** Cold start varies (27.8-84.7% depending on workspace), but recovers to 99%+ in 1-2 requests. Sub-agents start at 0% but warm quickly to 91%+

### npm Package (Node.js)

- Installed via `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Ships as a **bundled JavaScript file** (`cli.js`, ~13MB) executed by Node.js
- **Does not contain** the Sentinel replacement logic — immune to Bug 1
- Dependencies are bundled inline (zero external npm packages at runtime, no supply chain risk)

### Head-to-Head Benchmark (v2.1.90, same machine, same proxy)

| Metric | npm | Standalone | Winner |
|--------|-----|-----------|--------|
| Overall cache read % | 86.4% | 86.2% | Tie |
| Stable session | 95-99.8% | 95-99.7% | Tie |
| Sub-agent cold start | 79-87% | 47-67% | npm |
| Sub-agent warmed (5+ req) | 87-94% | 94-99% | Tie |
| Usage for full test suite | 7% of Max 20 | 5% of Max 20 | Tie |

**On v2.1.90:** npm had a 12-40pp advantage on sub-agent cold starts (79-87% vs 47-67%). Both reached 94-99% once warmed (3-5 requests). **On v2.1.91:** this gap is closed — both hit 84.7% on cold start. See **[BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md)** for per-request data.

### Coexistence Setup

Both can coexist on the same machine at different paths:

```bash
# npm install (does NOT affect standalone binary)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Check what you have
file $(which claude)
# ELF 64-bit = standalone binary
# symbolic link to .../cli.js = npm

# If both are installed, use aliases to pick:
alias claude-npm="ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 /path/to/npm/claude"
alias claude-bin="ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 /path/to/standalone/claude"
```

## Root Cause

Below are the technical details for each bug. Bugs 1-2 (cache layer) are fixed. Bugs 3-5 and 8 are the ones still causing problems — if you're experiencing drain on v2.1.91, these are why.

Bugs 1-2 were identified through community reverse engineering ([Reddit analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/s/AY2GHQa5Z6)). Bugs 3-5 and 8 were discovered through proxy-based testing on April 2-3, 2026:

### Bug 1 — Sentinel Replacement (standalone binary only)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#40524](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40524)

The standalone binary's embedded Bun fork contains a `cch=00000` sentinel replacement mechanism. Under certain conditions, the sentinel in `messages` gets incorrectly substituted — breaking the cache prefix and forcing a full rebuild.

- **v2.1.89:** Catastrophic — cache read drops to 4-17%, never recovers
- **v2.1.90:** Partially mitigated — cold start still affected (47-67%), but recovers to 94-99% after warming
- **npm:** Not affected — the JavaScript bundle does not contain this logic

**Official fix in v2.1.89-90 ([changelog](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog)):**
- v2.1.89: *"Fixed prompt cache misses in long sessions caused by tool schema bytes changing mid-session"*
- v2.1.90: *"Improved performance: eliminated per-turn JSON.stringify of MCP tool schemas on cache-key lookup"*

### Bug 2 — Resume Cache Breakage (v2.1.69+)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#34629](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/34629)

`deferred_tools_delta` (introduced in v2.1.69) causes the first message's structure on `--resume` to not match the server's cached version — resulting in a complete cache miss. On a 500K token conversation, a single resume costs ~$0.15 in quota.

**Official fix in v2.1.90 ([changelog](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog)):**
> *"Fixed --resume causing a full prompt-cache miss on the first request for users with deferred tools, MCP servers, or custom agents (regression since v2.1.69)"*

**Note:** `--continue` has the same cache invalidation behavior ([#42338](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42338) confirmed). While v2.1.90-91 changelogs address `--resume`, we recommend avoiding both `--resume` and `--continue` until fully verified — start fresh sessions instead.

### Bug 3 — Client-Side False Rate Limiter (all versions)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584)

The local rate limiter generates **synthetic "Rate limit reached" errors** without ever calling the Anthropic API. These errors are identifiable in session logs by:

```json
{
  "model": "<synthetic>",
  "usage": { "input_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 0 }
}
```

Triggered by large transcripts and concurrent sub-agent spawns. [@rwp65](https://github.com/rwp65) observed it with a ~74MB transcript in [#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584). The rate limiter appears to multiply `context_size × concurrent_requests`, so multi-agent workflows get blocked even when each individual request is small.

- **Discovery:** [@rwp65](https://github.com/rwp65) in [#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584) (March 29, 2026)
- **Cross-referenced by:** [@marlvinvu](https://github.com/marlvinvu) across [#40438](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40438), [#39938](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/39938), [#38239](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/38239)
- **Status:** **Unfixed** — present in all versions through v2.1.91
- **Impact:** Users see "Rate limit reached" immediately, even after hours of inactivity when the budget should have fully reset. No API call is made, so the error is entirely client-generated.

### Bug 4 — Silent Microcompact → Context Quality Degradation (v2.1.89+)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#42542](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42542)

Three compaction mechanisms in `src/services/compact/` run **silently on every API call**, stripping old tool results without user notification.

| Mechanism | Source | Trigger | Control |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Time-based microcompact** | `microCompact.ts:422` | Gap since last assistant message exceeds threshold | GrowthBook: `getTimeBasedMCConfig()` |
| **Cached microcompact** | `microCompact.ts:305` | Count-based trigger, uses `cache_edits` API to delete old tool results | GrowthBook: `getCachedMCConfig()` |
| **Session memory compact** | `sessionMemoryCompact.ts:57` | Runs before autocompact | GrowthBook flag |

**Key findings:**
- All three bypass `DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT` and `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE`
- Controlled by **server-side GrowthBook A/B testing flags** — Anthropic can change behavior without a client update
- Tool results silently replaced with `[Old tool result content cleared]` — no compaction notification shown
- **327 clearing events across all tested sessions** detected via proxy across multiple sessions
- All cleared indices are **even-numbered** → targets tool_use/tool_result pairs specifically
- Cleared indices **expand over time** as conversation grows

**Cache impact (updated April 3 — measured):**

Our proxy-based testing revealed a **correction** to the initial hypothesis: microcompact does NOT cause sustained cache invalidation in main sessions.

| Context | Cache ratio during clearing |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Main session | **99%+** — no impact (stable substitution preserves prefix) |
| Sub-agent cold start | **0-39%** — drops observed at clearing moments |
| Sub-agent warmed | **94-99%** — recovers normally |

Cache ratio stays high because the same `[Old tool result content cleared]` marker is substituted consistently, preserving the prompt prefix between calls. But the model can no longer see the original file contents or command outputs — it only sees the placeholder. In practice, this means the agent can't accurately quote earlier tool results and may retry approaches it already tried. [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th) reports effective context dropping to ~40-80K tokens in sessions with 50+ tool uses despite the 1M window — a 95-96% reduction in usable context.

- **Update (April 3):** GrowthBook flag survey across 4 machines / 4 accounts shows **all gates disabled** — yet context is still being stripped (a compaction code path independent of the three documented GrowthBook-gated mechanisms). See [MICROCOMPACT.md](MICROCOMPACT.md) for full analysis.
- **Discovery:** [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th) in [#42542](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42542) (April 2, 2026)
- **Status:** **Unfixed** in v2.1.91. 14 events detected in v2.1.91 test sessions, identical pattern.

### Bug 5 — Tool Result Budget Enforcement (all versions, NEW)

**Discovered:** April 3, 2026 (via cc-relay proxy enhancement)
**Source:** [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th) identified the GrowthBook flags; we confirmed behavioral activation.

A **separate pre-request pipeline** (`applyToolResultBudget()`) truncates tool results based on server-controlled thresholds. This runs BEFORE microcompact (Bug 4) and is independent of it.

**Active GrowthBook flags (confirmed in `~/.claude.json`):**
```
tengu_hawthorn_window:       200,000  (aggregate tool result cap across all messages)
tengu_pewter_kestrel:        {global: 50000, Bash: 30000, Grep: 20000, Snip: 1000}
tengu_summarize_tool_results: true    (system prompt tells model to expect clearing)
```

**Measured impact:**
- **261 budget events** detected in a single session when total tool result chars exceeded 200K
- Tool results reduced to **1-41 characters** (from original thousands+)
- Budget threshold exceeded at **242,094 chars** (> 200K cap)
- After ~15-20 file reads, older results are silently truncated

**v2.1.91:** Added `_meta["anthropic/maxResultSizeChars"]` (up to 500K) — but this only applies to **MCP tool results**. Built-in tools (Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, Edit) are **not affected** by this override. The 200K aggregate cap remains for normal usage.

**No env var override exists.** `DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT`, `DISABLE_COMPACT`, and all other known environment variables do not touch this code path.

### Bug 8 — JSONL Log Duplication (all versions)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#41346](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/41346)

Extended thinking generates **2-5 PRELIM entries** per API call in session JSONL files, with identical `cache_read_input_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens` as the FINAL entry. This inflates local token accounting.

**Measured (April 3):**

| Session Type | PRELIM | FINAL | Ratio | Token Inflation |
|-------------|--------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Main session | 79 | 82 | 0.96x | **2.87x** |
| Sub-agent | 39 | 20 | 1.95x | — |
| Sub-agent | 12 | 7 | 1.71x | — |
| Previous session | 16 | 6 | **2.67x** | — |

**Open question:** Does the server-side rate limiter count PRELIM entries? If yes, extended thinking sessions are charged 2-3x more against the rate limit than the actual API usage.

## Measured Data

### Methodology

Transparent local monitoring proxy using [`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings#environment-variables) (official environment variable). The proxy logs `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` from each API response without modifying requests or responses (source-audited).

### v2.1.89 Standalone — Before Fix (Broken, JSONL data)

| Session | Entries | Avg Cache Read | Min | Status |
|---------|---------|---------------|-----|--------|
| `64d42269` (4/1 16:33) | 233 | **47.0%** | 8.3% | drain starting |
| `9100c2d2` (4/1 18:04) | 89 | **36.1%** | 21.1% | worst drain — triggered investigation |
| Session A (earlier JSONL) | 168 | **4.3%** | — | poor — 20x cost inflation |

After downgrading to v2.1.68 (npm): `892388f6` recovered to **97.6% average** (119 entries, min 60.9%).

### v2.1.90 — After Fix (Both Installations)

| Metric | npm (Node.js) | Standalone (ELF) |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Scenarios completed | 7 (incl. 79-report parallel agent read) | 4 (forge, browsegrab, feedkit 5-turn, 3-project parallel) |
| Usage consumed | 28% → 35% (**7%**) | 35% → 40% (**5%**) |
| Overall cache read | **86.4%** | **86.2%** |
| Stable session read | **95-99.8%** | **95-99.7%** |

Full per-request data and warming curves: **[BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md)**

### Version Comparison Summary (Full Benchmark, Same Scenarios)

| Metric | v2.1.89 Standalone | v2.1.90 npm | v2.1.90 standalone | v2.1.91 npm | v2.1.91 standalone |
|--------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Cold start | **4-17%** | 63-80% | **14-47%** | **84.5%** | **27.8%** |
| Recovery to 95%+ | Never | 3-5 reqs | 3-5 reqs | **2 reqs** | **1 req** |
| Sub-agent cold | — | 54-80% | 14-47% | **54%** | **0%** |
| Sub-agent stable | — | 87-94% | 94-99% | **93-99%** | **91-99%** |
| Stable session | 90-99% | **95-99.8%** | **95-99.7%** | **98-99.6%** | **94-99%** |
| Overall | ~20% | 86.4% | 86.2% | **88.4%** | **84.1%** |
| Verdict | **Avoid** | Good | Good | **Best** | **Good** |

v2.1.91 standalone cold start varies by workspace (27.8% in full benchmark vs 84.7% in single-prompt test), but recovery is dramatically faster than v2.1.90 (1 request vs 3-5). Both installations converge to 94-99% once warmed. See **[BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md)** for per-request data.

## Usage Precautions

### Behaviors to Avoid

| Behavior | Why | Measured Impact |
|----------|-----|-----------------|
| `--resume` | Replays entire conversation history as billable input including opaque thinking block signatures | 500K+ tokens per resume ([#42260](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42260)) |
| `/dream`, `/insights` | Background API calls consume tokens without visible output | Silent drain ([#40438](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40438)) |
| v2.1.89 or earlier standalone | Sentinel bug causes sustained 4-17% cache read | 3-4x token waste, never recovers |
| Enabling auto-update | Future versions may reintroduce regressions | Pin v2.1.91 until Bugs 3-5 are fixed |

### Behaviors to Use with Caution

| Behavior | Why | Recommendation |
|----------|-----|----------------|
| Parallel sub-agents (single terminal) | Each agent starts with fresh context, but warms up and shares billing context | **Safe** — agents warm up to 94-99% after 3-5 requests |
| Multiple terminals simultaneously | Each terminal is a fully independent session — no cache sharing, parallel quota drain | **Limit to one active terminal** |
| Large CLAUDE.md / context files | Sent on every turn — with broken cache, billed at full price each time | Keep lean; less critical on v2.1.90 with working cache |
| Session start / compaction | `cache_creation` spikes are structural and unavoidable | Normal — budget for it |

### Server-Side Factors (Unresolved)

Even with cache at 95-99%, drain persists. As of April 3, the [#38335 mega-thread](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/38335) has 365+ comments and [#16157](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16157) has 1,400+ — both still active with new reports on v2.1.90-91. At least three server-side issues contribute:

**1. Server-side accounting change:** Old Docker versions (v2.1.74, v2.1.86 — never updated) started draining fast recently, proving the issue isn't purely client-side ([#37394](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/37394), reported by [@pablofuenzalidadf](https://github.com/pablofuenzalidadf)).

**2. 1M context billing regression:** Max plans include 1M context free (announced March 13, confirmed March 20), but a late-March regression causes the server to incorrectly classify these requests as "extra usage." Debug logs show a 429 error at only ~23K tokens with `"Extra usage is required for long context requests"` on a Max plan with 1M context enabled ([#42616](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42616), request ID: `req_011CZf8TJf84hAUziB6LuRoc`). Related display bug: [#42569](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42569).

**3. Org-level quota sharing:** Accounts under the same organization share rate limit pools. Source code analysis shows `passesEligibilityCache` and `overageCreditGrantCache` are keyed by `organizationUuid`, not `accountUuid` — meaning separate subscriptions on the same org can drain each other's quota.

## Quick Setup Guide

### For New Users

```bash
# 1. Install via npm (recommended — no Sentinel bug)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# 2. Disable auto-update
cat > ~/.claude/settings.json << 'EOF'
{
  "env": {
    "DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER": "1"
  }
}
EOF

# 3. Verify
claude --version   # should show 2.1.91 or later
file $(which claude)   # should show symbolic link to cli.js
```

### For Existing Standalone Users

```bash
# 1. Update to v2.1.91
claude update

# 2. Disable auto-update (add to existing settings.json)
# Add "DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER": "1" to the "env" section

# 3. Verify
claude --version   # should show 2.1.91 or later
```

### Optional: Monitor Cache Efficiency

Set up a transparent proxy using `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to log cache metrics:

```bash
# Route through local proxy for monitoring
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 claude

# Parse cache_creation_input_tokens / cache_read_input_tokens from responses
# Healthy: read ratio > 80%  |  Affected: read ratio < 40%
```

---

## How to Check If You're Affected

The session JSONL files in `~/.claude/projects/` contain usage data for each turn:

- **Healthy session:** `cache_read` >> `cache_creation` (read ratio > 80%)
- **Affected session:** `cache_creation` >> `cache_read` (read ratio < 40%)

If most sessions show low read ratios, you're likely on an affected version. Update to v2.1.91.

### Session Loading / JSONL Pipeline
- [#43044](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/43044) — **`--resume` loads 0% context on v2.1.91** — three regressions in session loading pipeline: `walkChainBeforeParse` removed, `ExY` timestamp bridging fork boundaries, missing `leafUuids` check (by [@kolkov](https://github.com/kolkov)). Different layer from API cache bugs — see [analysis](#related-session-loading-analysis)

### Anthropic Official Response

**GitHub:** Zero responses across 91+ rate-limit issues (2+ months of silence).

**April 2, 2026 — Lydia Hallie (Anthropic, Product) posted on X:**

> *"Peak-hour limits are tighter and 1M-context sessions got bigger, that's most of what you're feeling. We fixed a few bugs along the way, but none were over-charging you."*

**Our measured data raises questions about this assessment:**
- **Bug 5 (200K cap):** Tool results silently truncated to 1-41 chars after the aggregate 200K threshold. Users paying for 1M context effectively have a 200K tool result budget for built-in tools — the rest is silently discarded.
- **Bug 3 (synthetic RL):** 151 `<synthetic>` entries across 65 sessions on our setup alone. The client blocks API calls without server involvement — users see "Rate limit reached" with zero actual API consumption.
- **Bug 8 (PRELIM duplication):** Extended thinking sessions log 2-3x more token entries than actual API calls. Whether the server-side rate limiter counts these remains an open question.

Most useful for **harness setups** that call `claude -p --resume` on every turn (e.g., Discord bots) — in interactive sessions the impact is minimal since resumes are infrequent and v2.1.91 already handles the main regression

- [tokenlean](https://github.com/edimuj/tokenlean) — 54 CLI tools for agents (extracts symbols/snippets instead of full file reads, reduces base token count)

### Related Session Loading Analysis

<a id="related-session-loading-analysis"></a>

[@kolkov](https://github.com/kolkov) independently analyzed v2.1.91 `--resume` regressions at the **JSONL DAG / session loading layer** — a different level from the API-level cache, microcompact, and budget cap bugs documented above.

**Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#43044](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/43044) — *"Bug: --resume loads 0% context on v2.1.91 — three regressions in session loading pipeline (source code verified)"*

**Three v2.1.91 regressions identified:**

| # | Regression | Effect |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | `walkChainBeforeParse` removed | Fork pruning gone for JSONL files >5MB — resume loads entire raw log instead of the active chain |
| 2 | `ExY` timestamp fallback bridges fork boundaries | Session forks that should be separate get merged across timestamp boundaries |
| 3 | Missing `leafUuids` check in `getLastSessionLog` | Last-session detection picks wrong log file when multiple forks exist |

**Tool:** [ccdiag](https://github.com/kolkov/ccdiag) — Go-based JSONL recovery tool for diagnosing and repairing session logs affected by these regressions.

**Relationship to this analysis:** This repo focuses on API-level prompt cache efficiency (sentinel, cache keys, microcompact, budget cap). Kolkov's findings cover the **pre-API pipeline** — how the client reconstructs conversation history from on-disk JSONL logs before sending it to the API. Both layers contribute to `--resume` problems, but at different stages: kolkov's bugs affect *what gets loaded*, while our Bug 2 affects *whether the loaded content gets cached by the API*.
