## Bug 1 — Sentinel Replacement (standalone binary only)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#40524](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40524)

The standalone binary's embedded Bun fork contains a `cch=00000` sentinel replacement mechanism. Under certain conditions, the sentinel in `messages` gets incorrectly substituted — breaking the cache prefix and forcing a full rebuild.

- **v2.1.89:** Catastrophic — cache read drops to 4-17%, never recovers
- **v2.1.90:** Partially mitigated — cold start still affected (47-67%), but recovers to 94-99% after warming
- **npm:** Not affected — the JavaScript bundle does not contain this logic

**Official fix in v2.1.89-90 ([changelog](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog)):**
- v2.1.89: *"Fixed prompt cache misses in long sessions caused by tool schema bytes changing mid-session"*
- v2.1.90: *"Improved performance: eliminated per-turn JSON.stringify of MCP tool schemas on cache-key lookup"*

## Bug 2 — Resume Cache Breakage (v2.1.69+)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#34629](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/34629)

`deferred_tools_delta` (introduced in v2.1.69) causes the first message's structure on `--resume` to not match the server's cached version — resulting in a complete cache miss. On a 500K token conversation, a single resume costs ~$0.15 in quota.

**Official fix in v2.1.90 ([changelog](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog)):**
> *"Fixed --resume causing a full prompt-cache miss on the first request for users with deferred tools, MCP servers, or custom agents (regression since v2.1.69)"*

**Note:** `--continue` has the same cache invalidation behavior ([#42338](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42338) confirmed). We recommend avoiding both `--resume` and `--continue` until fully verified — start fresh sessions instead.

## Bug 3 — Client-Side False Rate Limiter (all versions)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584)

The local rate limiter generates **synthetic "Rate limit reached" errors** without ever calling the Anthropic API. These errors are identifiable in session logs by:

```json
{
  "model": "<synthetic>",
  "usage": { "input_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 0 }
}
```

Triggered by large transcripts and concurrent sub-agent spawns. [@rwp65](https://github.com/rwp65) observed it with a ~74MB transcript in [#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584). The rate limiter appears to multiply `context_size × concurrent_requests`, so multi-agent workflows get blocked even when each individual request is small.

- **Discovery:** [@rwp65](https://github.com/rwp65) in [#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584) (March 29, 2026)
- **Cross-referenced by:** [@marlvinvu](https://github.com/marlvinvu) across [#40438](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40438), [#39938](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/39938), [#38239](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/38239)
- **Status:** **Unfixed** — present in all versions through v2.1.91
- **Impact:** Users see "Rate limit reached" immediately, even after hours of inactivity when the budget should have fully reset. No API call is made, so the error is entirely client-generated.

## Bug 4 — Silent Microcompact → Context Quality Degradation (all versions, server-controlled)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#42542](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42542)

Three compaction mechanisms in `src/services/compact/` run **silently on every API call**, stripping old tool results without user notification.

| Mechanism | Source | Trigger | Control |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Time-based microcompact** | `microCompact.ts:422` | Gap since last assistant message exceeds threshold | GrowthBook: `getTimeBasedMCConfig()` |
| **Cached microcompact** | `microCompact.ts:305` | Count-based trigger, uses `cache_edits` API to delete old tool results | GrowthBook: `getCachedMCConfig()` |
| **Session memory compact** | `sessionMemoryCompact.ts:57` | Runs before autocompact | GrowthBook flag |

**Key findings:**
- All three bypass `DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT` and `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE`
- Controlled by **server-side GrowthBook A/B testing flags** — Anthropic can change behavior without a client update
- Tool results silently replaced with `[Old tool result content cleared]` — no compaction notification shown
- **327 clearing events across all tested sessions** detected via proxy across multiple sessions
- All cleared indices are **even-numbered** → targets tool_use/tool_result pairs specifically
- Cleared indices **expand over time** as conversation grows

**Cache impact (updated April 3 — measured):**

Our proxy-based testing revealed a **correction** to the initial hypothesis: microcompact does NOT cause sustained cache invalidation in main sessions.

| Context | Cache ratio during clearing |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Main session | **99%+** — no impact (stable substitution preserves prefix) |
| Sub-agent cold start | **0-39%** — drops observed at clearing moments |
| Sub-agent warmed | **94-99%** — recovers normally |

Cache ratio stays high because the same `[Old tool result content cleared]` marker is substituted consistently, preserving the prompt prefix between calls. But the model can no longer see the original file contents or command outputs — it only sees the placeholder. In practice, this means the agent can't accurately quote earlier tool results and may retry approaches it already tried. [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th) reports effective context dropping to ~40-80K tokens in sessions with 50+ tool uses despite the 1M window — a 92-96% reduction in usable context.

- **Update (April 3):** GrowthBook flag survey across 4 machines / 4 accounts shows **all gates disabled** — yet context is still being stripped (a compaction code path independent of the three documented GrowthBook-gated mechanisms). See [05_MICROCOMPACT.md](05_MICROCOMPACT.md) for full analysis.
- **Discovery:** [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th) in [#42542](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42542) (April 2, 2026)
- **Status:** **Unfixed** in v2.1.91. 14 events detected in v2.1.91 test sessions, identical pattern.

## Bug 5 — Tool Result Budget Enforcement (all versions)

**Discovered:** April 3, 2026 (via cc-relay proxy enhancement)
**Source:** [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th) identified the GrowthBook flags; we confirmed behavioral activation.

A **separate pre-request pipeline** (`applyToolResultBudget()`) truncates tool results based on server-controlled thresholds. This runs BEFORE microcompact (Bug 4) and is independent of it.

**Active GrowthBook flags (confirmed in `~/.claude.json`):**
```
tengu_hawthorn_window:       200,000  (aggregate tool result cap across all messages)
tengu_pewter_kestrel:        {global: 50000, Bash: 30000, Grep: 20000, Snip: 1000}
tengu_summarize_tool_results: true    (system prompt tells model to expect clearing)
```

**Measured impact:**
- **261 budget events** detected in a single session when total tool result chars exceeded 200K
- Tool results reduced to **1-41 characters** (from original thousands+)
- Budget threshold exceeded at **242,094 chars** (> 200K cap)
- After ~15-20 file reads, older results are silently truncated

**v2.1.91:** Added `_meta["anthropic/maxResultSizeChars"]` (up to 500K) — but this only applies to **MCP tool results**. Built-in tools (Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, Edit) are **not affected** by this override. The 200K aggregate cap remains for normal usage.

**No env var override exists.** `DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT`, `DISABLE_COMPACT`, and all other known environment variables do not touch this code path.

## Bug 8 — JSONL Log Duplication (all versions)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#41346](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/41346)

Extended thinking generates **2-5 PRELIM entries** per API call in session JSONL files, with identical `cache_read_input_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens` as the FINAL entry. This inflates local token accounting.

**Measured (April 3):**

| Session Type | PRELIM | FINAL | Ratio | Token Inflation |
|-------------|--------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Main session | 79 | 82 | 0.96x | **2.87x** |
| Sub-agent | 39 | 20 | 1.95x | — |
| Sub-agent | 12 | 7 | 1.71x | — |
| Previous session | 16 | 6 | **2.67x** | — |

**Open question:** Does the server-side rate limiter count PRELIM entries? If yes, extended thinking sessions are charged 2-3x more against the rate limit than the actual API usage.

## Measured Data

### Methodology

Transparent local monitoring proxy using [`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings#environment-variables) (official environment variable). The proxy logs `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` from each API response without modifying requests or responses (source-audited).

### v2.1.89 Standalone — Before Fix (Broken, JSONL data)

| Session | Entries | Avg Cache Read | Min | Status |
|---------|---------|---------------|-----|--------|
| `64d42269` (4/1 16:33) | 233 | **47.0%** | 8.3% | drain starting |
| `9100c2d2` (4/1 18:04) | 89 | **36.1%** | 21.1% | worst drain — triggered investigation |
| Session A (earlier JSONL) | 168 | **4.3%** | — | poor — 20x cost inflation |

After downgrading to v2.1.68 (npm): `892388f6` recovered to **97.6% average** (119 entries, min 60.9%).

### v2.1.90 — After Fix (Both Installations)

| Metric | npm (Node.js) | Standalone (ELF) |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Scenarios completed | 7 (incl. 79-report parallel agent read) | 4 (forge, browsegrab, feedkit 5-turn, 3-project parallel) |
| Usage consumed | 28% → 35% (**7%**) | 35% → 40% (**5%**) |
| Overall cache read | **86.4%** | **86.2%** |
| Stable session read | **95-99.8%** | **95-99.7%** |

Full per-request data and warming curves: **[04_BENCHMARK.md](04_BENCHMARK.md)**

### Version Comparison Summary

| Metric | v2.1.89 Standalone | v2.1.90 npm | v2.1.90 standalone | v2.1.91 npm | v2.1.91 standalone |
|--------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Cold start | **4-17%** | 63-80% | **14-47%** | **84.5%** | **27.8%** |
| Recovery to 95%+ | Never | 3-5 reqs | 3-5 reqs | **2 reqs** | **1 req** |
| Sub-agent cold | — | 54-80% | 14-47% | **54%** | **0%** |
| Sub-agent stable | — | 87-94% | 94-99% | **93-99%** | **91-99%** |
| Stable session | 90-99% | **95-99.8%** | **95-99.7%** | **98-99.6%** | **94-99%** |
| Overall | ~20% | 86.4% | 86.2% | **88.4%** | **84.1%** |
| Verdict | **Avoid** | Good | Good | **Best** | **Good** |

v2.1.91 standalone cold start varies by workspace (27.8% in full benchmark vs 84.7% in single-prompt test), but recovery is dramatically faster than v2.1.90 (1 request vs 3-5). Both installations converge to 94-99% once warmed. See **[04_BENCHMARK.md](04_BENCHMARK.md)** for per-request data.
