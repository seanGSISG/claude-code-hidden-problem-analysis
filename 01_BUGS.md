## Bug 1 — Sentinel Replacement (standalone binary only)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#40524](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40524)

The standalone binary's embedded Bun fork contains a `cch=00000` sentinel replacement mechanism. Under certain conditions, the sentinel in `messages` gets incorrectly substituted — breaking the cache prefix and forcing a full rebuild.

- **v2.1.89:** Catastrophic — cache read drops to 4-17%, never recovers
- **v2.1.90:** Partially mitigated — cold start still affected (47-67%), but recovers to 94-99% after warming
- **npm:** Not affected — the JavaScript bundle does not contain this logic

**Official fix in v2.1.89-90 ([changelog](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog)):**
- v2.1.89: *"Fixed prompt cache misses in long sessions caused by tool schema bytes changing mid-session"*
- v2.1.90: *"Improved performance: eliminated per-turn JSON.stringify of MCP tool schemas on cache-key lookup"*

---

## Bug 2 — Resume Cache Breakage (v2.1.69+)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#34629](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/34629)

`deferred_tools_delta` (introduced in v2.1.69) causes the first message's structure on `--resume` to not match the server's cached version — resulting in a complete cache miss. On a 500K token conversation, a single resume forces a full-price input pass over the entire context — the equivalent of replaying the whole conversation from scratch.

**Official fix in v2.1.90 ([changelog](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog)):**
> *"Fixed --resume causing a full prompt-cache miss on the first request for users with deferred tools, MCP servers, or custom agents (regression since v2.1.69)"*

**Note:** `--continue` has the same cache invalidation behavior ([#42338](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42338) confirmed). We recommend avoiding both `--resume` and `--continue` until fully verified — start fresh sessions instead.

### Note: Residual First-Turn Cache Miss (post-fix, self-measured April 13)

Even after B1/B2 fixes (v2.1.91+), new sessions frequently show `cache_read=0` on the first API call. Community analysis ([#47098](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/47098), [@wadabum](https://github.com/wadabum)) identified a structural cause: skills and project `CLAUDE.md` content are assembled into `messages[0]` user-content blocks rather than the `system[]` prefix. Since Anthropic's prompt caching is **prefix-based**, any variation in `messages[0]` invalidates the prefix — even if the system prompt itself is identical.

**Self-measured (April 13, cc-relay usage.db):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sessions analyzed (≥3 requests) | 143 |
| First-turn `cache_read=0` | **113 (79.0%)** |
| First-turn `cache_read>0` | 30 (21.0%) |
| Data source | cc-relay proxy, April 4–13, multiple CC versions |

Nearly 4 in 5 new sessions start with a full cache miss on the first turn. This is not a regression from B1/B2 — it is a **structural limitation** of the system prompt assembly architecture, partially mitigated in newer versions (community data suggests improvement from ~91% on v2.1.94 to ~29% on v2.1.104, though with small sample sizes and uncontrolled conditions).

## Bug 3 — Client-Side False Rate Limiter (all versions)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584)

The local rate limiter generates **synthetic "Rate limit reached" errors** without ever calling the Anthropic API. These errors are identifiable in session logs by:

```json
{
  "model": "<synthetic>",
  "usage": { "input_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 0 }
}
```

Triggered by large transcripts and concurrent sub-agent spawns. [@rwp65](https://github.com/rwp65) observed it with a ~74MB transcript in [#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584). The rate limiter appears to multiply `context_size × concurrent_requests`, so multi-agent workflows get blocked even when each individual request is small.

- **Discovery:** [@rwp65](https://github.com/rwp65) in [#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584) (March 29, 2026)
- **Cross-referenced by:** [@marlvinvu](https://github.com/marlvinvu) across [#40438](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40438), [#39938](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/39938), [#38239](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/38239)
- **Status:** **Unfixed** — present in all versions through v2.1.97
- **Impact:** Users see "Rate limit reached" immediately, even after hours of inactivity when the budget should have fully reset. No API call is made, so the error is entirely client-generated.

## Bug 4 — Silent Microcompact → Context Quality Degradation (all versions, server-controlled)

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#42542](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42542)

Three compaction mechanisms in `src/services/compact/` run **silently on every API call**, stripping old tool results without user notification.

| Mechanism | Source | Trigger | Control |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Time-based microcompact** | `microCompact.ts:422` | Gap since last assistant message exceeds threshold | GrowthBook: `getTimeBasedMCConfig()` |
| **Cached microcompact** | `microCompact.ts:305` | Count-based trigger, uses `cache_edits` API to delete old tool results | GrowthBook: `getCachedMCConfig()` |
| **Session memory compact** | `sessionMemoryCompact.ts:57` | Runs before autocompact | GrowthBook flag |

**Key findings:**
- All three bypass `DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT` and `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE`
- Controlled by **server-side GrowthBook A/B testing flags** — Anthropic can change behavior without a client update
- Tool results silently replaced with `[Old tool result content cleared]` — no compaction notification shown
- **5,500 clearing events** (18,858 items cleared) detected via proxy (April 1-13). Bug discovered April 2; proxy started April 1. Previously 327 (April 3 focused test only)
- All cleared indices are **even-numbered** → targets tool_use/tool_result pairs specifically
- Cleared indices **expand over time** as conversation grows

**Cache impact (updated April 3 — measured):**

Our proxy-based testing revealed a **correction** to the initial hypothesis: microcompact does NOT cause sustained cache invalidation in main sessions.

| Context | Cache ratio during clearing |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Main session | **99%+** — no impact (stable substitution preserves prefix) |
| Sub-agent cold start | **0-39%** — drops observed at clearing moments |
| Sub-agent warmed | **94-99%** — recovers normally |

Cache ratio stays high because the same `[Old tool result content cleared]` marker is substituted consistently, preserving the prompt prefix between calls. But the model can no longer see the original file contents or command outputs — it only sees the placeholder. In practice, this means the agent can't accurately quote earlier tool results and may retry approaches it already tried. [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th) reports effective context dropping to ~40-80K tokens in sessions with 50+ tool uses despite the 1M window — a 92-96% reduction in usable context.

- **Update (April 3):** GrowthBook flag survey across 4 machines / 4 accounts shows **all gates disabled** — yet context is still being stripped (a compaction code path independent of the three documented GrowthBook-gated mechanisms). See [05_MICROCOMPACT.md](05_MICROCOMPACT.md) for full analysis.
- **Discovery:** [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th) in [#42542](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42542) (April 2, 2026)
- **Status:** **Unfixed** in v2.1.91. 14 events detected in v2.1.91 test sessions, identical pattern.

## Bug 5 — Tool Result Budget Enforcement (all versions)

**Discovered:** April 3, 2026 (via cc-relay proxy enhancement)
**Source:** [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th) identified the GrowthBook flags; we confirmed behavioral activation.

A **separate pre-request pipeline** (`applyToolResultBudget()`) truncates tool results based on server-controlled thresholds. This runs BEFORE microcompact (Bug 4) and is independent of it.

**Active GrowthBook flags (confirmed in `~/.claude.json`):**
```
tengu_hawthorn_window:       200,000  (aggregate tool result cap across all messages)
tengu_pewter_kestrel:        {global: 50000, Bash: 30000, Grep: 20000, Snip: 1000}
tengu_summarize_tool_results: true    (system prompt tells model to expect clearing)
```

**Measured impact:**
- **167,818 budget events** across 218 sessions (April 1-13). Previously 261 in a single session (April 3)
- **100% truncation rate** — every event results in content reduction
- **90.6% of events** truncate to 11-100 chars; 9.4% to 0-10 chars (average: 24 chars)
- Budget threshold exceeded at **242,094 chars** (> 200K cap)
- After ~15-20 file reads, older results are silently truncated

**v2.1.91:** Added `_meta["anthropic/maxResultSizeChars"]` (up to 500K) — but this only applies to **MCP tool results**. Built-in tools (Read, Bash, Grep, Glob, Edit) are **not affected** by this override. The 200K aggregate cap remains for normal usage.

**No env var override exists.** `DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT`, `DISABLE_COMPACT`, and all other known environment variables do not touch this code path.

---

> **Note on numbering:** Bugs 6 and 7 were identified during the investigation (compaction infinite loop and OAuth retry storm respectively) but are tracked separately in [07_TIMELINE.md](07_TIMELINE.md) as they relate to older, less reproducible issues. This document focuses on the actively measurable bugs.

---

## Bug 8 — JSONL Log Duplication (all versions)

> **See also Bug 8a below** for a related but distinct JSONL corruption bug discovered April 9.

**GitHub Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#41346](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/41346)

Extended thinking generates **2-5 PRELIM entries** per API call in session JSONL files, with identical `cache_read_input_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens` as the FINAL entry. This inflates local token accounting.

**Measured (April 3, single session):**

| Session Type | PRELIM | FINAL | Ratio | Token Inflation |
|-------------|--------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Main session | 79 | 82 | 0.96x | **2.87x** |
| Sub-agent | 39 | 20 | 1.95x | — |
| Sub-agent | 12 | 7 | 1.71x | — |
| Previous session | 16 | 6 | **2.67x** | — |

**Bulk scan (April 8, 532 files):** B8 is **universal** — 100% of top 10 largest sessions exhibit PRELIM/FINAL duplication. Average token inflation: **2.37x** (range 1.45x-4.42x). Worst case: 734f00e7 at 4.42x (77% of logged input tokens are duplicated PRELIM entries).

**Open question:** Does the server-side rate limiter count PRELIM entries? If yes, extended thinking sessions are charged 2-3x more against the rate limit than the actual API usage.

## Bug 8a — JSONL Non-Atomic Write Corruption (v2.1.85+)

**GitHub Issues:** [#45286](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/45286), [#31328](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/31328), [#21321](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21321)

**Added:** April 9, 2026

Distinct from Bug 8 (duplication). When Claude Code executes multiple tools concurrently, the JSONL writer can drop `tool_result` entries, creating orphaned `tool_use` blocks. Every subsequent API call fails validation (400 error), making the session **permanently unresumable**.

- Assistant message contains 3 `tool_use` blocks, but following user message contains only 2 `tool_result` blocks — the missing result was never written to disk
- The meta-issue [#21321](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21321) consolidates **10+ duplicate reports** of the same failure pattern
- Root cause: non-atomic JSONL writes during concurrent tool execution. Standard fix (temp file + fsync + rename) has not been applied

**Evidence strength:** **STRONG** — three independent issues (#45286, #31328, #21321) describe identical failure patterns across different reporters and versions. The frequency ("~1 in 10 sessions with heavy tool use" per one reporter) is unverified.

---

## Bug 9 — `/branch` Context Inflation (all versions)

**GitHub Issues:** [#45419](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/45419), [#40363](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40363), [#36000](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/36000)

**Added:** April 9, 2026

`/branch` duplicates or un-compacts message history, inflating context far beyond the parent session's actual size.

**Measured (April 8, @progerzua):**
- Parent session: **6% context** (59.7K/1M)
- After `/branch` + **one message**: **73% context** (735K/1M)
- Only the Messages category inflated (40.5K → 715.6K). All other categories unchanged.

**Root cause (from #40363):** `/branch` writes every message **twice** in the session file — parent had 8,892 lines/33MB, branch immediately 12,050+ lines. A related path (#36000): after autocompaction, `/branch` copies pre-compaction history plus the summary, effectively undoing the compaction.

**Interaction with B4/B5:** The inflated context (735K) immediately triggers aggressive microcompact clearing (B4) and blows past the 200K tool result budget (B5). A normal session takes 15-20 file reads to hit B5; after `/branch`, it can trigger on the first tool call.

**Evidence strength:** **STRONG** — three duplicate issues, screenshots + category breakdowns, known root cause. Self-closed as duplicate of existing open issue #40363.

---

## Bug 10 — TaskOutput Deprecation → Autocompact Thrashing (v2.1.92+)

**GitHub Issue:** [#44703](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/44703)

**Added:** April 9, 2026

The `TaskOutput` tool's deprecation message instructs agents to `Read` the full sub-agent `.output` file instead of using the summarized Agent tool result. For agent tasks, this injects the entire conversation history.

**Measured:**
- Agent tool summary: **4,087 chars**
- Full `.output` file via Read: **87,286 chars** (21x larger)
- Three consecutive autocompacts of ~167K tokens each → **"Autocompact is thrashing" fatal error**

The logic chain: deprecation message → agent follows instruction → reads full conversation JSON → 87K injected into context → autocompact threshold hit → compact runs → same Read happens again on next notification → thrashing → fatal.

**Interaction with Bug 5:** The 87K injection also instantly consumes nearly half of B5's 200K aggregate tool result budget, accelerating truncation of all prior tool results. B10 is a distinct root cause (deprecation message design) but its severity is amplified by B5's budget cap — without the 200K limit, the 87K injection would be large but survivable.

**Evidence strength:** **STRONG** — concrete JSONL log evidence, internally consistent numbers, known failure mode (autocompact thrashing) with existing duplicate #24764. Anthropic labeled `has repro` and closed, but with no engineer comment and no confirmed fix.

---

## Bug 11 — Adaptive Thinking Zero-Reasoning (server-side, acknowledged)

**Source:** [bcherny (Anthropic)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47668520) on Hacker News, April 6, 2026

**Added:** April 9, 2026

Adaptive thinking (introduced Feb 9, default medium effort=85 since Mar 3) can under-allocate reasoning to **zero** on certain turns, producing fabricated outputs.

**Anthropic acknowledgment (bcherny, HN):**
> *"The data points at adaptive thinking under-allocating reasoning on certain turns — the specific turns where it fabricated (stripe API version, git SHA suffix, apt package list) had zero reasoning emitted, while the turns with deep reasoning were correct. we're investigating with the model team."*

**Interaction with P3:** The "Output efficiency" system prompt (v2.1.64, "Try the simplest approach first") may amplify this bug — it encourages minimal reasoning, which adaptive thinking may interpret as justification for zero allocation on certain turns.

**Workaround:** `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING=1` (undocumented env var, confirmed present in 8+ issues)

**Evidence strength:** **STRONG** — Anthropic employee (bcherny, `@Anthropic`, "Claude Code @ Anthropic") directly acknowledged the bug on HN with specific fabrication examples. The env var workaround exists and is functional. Multiple users (redknightlois, ylluminate) independently report quality improvement after disabling.

## Bug 2a — SendMessage Resume Cache Miss (Agent SDK)

**GitHub Issue:** [#44724](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/44724)

**Added:** April 9, 2026

Extends Bug 2 (resume cache breakage) to a different code path: the Agent SDK's `SendMessage` orchestrator call. **Not a duplicate of B2** — B2's fix (v2.1.90-91) addressed CLI `--resume` with `deferred_tools_delta`; B2a occurs in the orchestrator's system prompt assembly, which is a separate code path unaffected by the B2 fix.

**Measured (@labzink):**

| Call | cache_create | cache_read | Status |
|------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Agent (1st) | 7,084 | 7,504 | Partial hit (system prompt cached) |
| SendMessage (2nd, 85s later) | 14,675 | **0** | **Full miss** |
| SendMessage (3rd) | 83 | 14,675 | Cache hit |

The first `SendMessage` resume always produces `cache_read=0` — a **complete cache miss** including the system prompt. This is more severe than the CLI `--resume` bug (B2), where the system prompt still caches (~8,760 read). [@cnighswonger](https://github.com/cnighswonger) independently confirmed: "nothing caches — not even the system prompt."

The 85-second gap between calls rules out TTL expiry (5-minute minimum). The likely cause is a different system prompt assembly path in the orchestrator vs the direct Agent call.

**Evidence strength:** **STRONG** — clear numerical data, independent confirmation by cnighswonger, explicitly differentiated from CLI resume bug. Single reproduction is the main weakness.

---

## Preliminary Findings (April 9, MODERATE — conditional inclusion)

The following findings have supporting evidence but require additional verification before being classified as confirmed bugs.

### P1/P2 — Cache TTL Dual Tiers (two triggers, likely one mechanism)

The Anthropic API returns two distinct cache TTL fields: `ephemeral_1h_input_tokens` (1-hour) and `ephemeral_5m_input_tokens` (5-minute). Two independent observations suggest the server downgrades clients from 1h to 5m TTL under specific conditions:

**Trigger A — Telemetry disabled (P1):**
- **GitHub Issue:** [#45381](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/45381) | **Anthropic label:** `has repro`
- Setting `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` or `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1` causes cache TTL to fall from 1h to 5m. Anthropic's triage team applied `has repro` — internal reproduction confirmed.
- Combined with [#44850](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/44850) (telemetry events getting 429'd), this creates a double bind: enable telemetry and it competes for rate limit budget; disable it and lose 12x cache longevity.

**Trigger B — Quota exceeded (P2):**
- **Source:** [@cnighswonger](https://github.com/cnighswonger) interceptor data (4,700+ calls)
- Crossing 100% of the 5h quota appears to trigger a silent downgrade from 1h to 5m TTL. On cnighswonger's account, this is bidirectional (reverts after reset). Other users in [#42052](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42052) report the 5m TTL persisting after reset.

**Likely shared mechanism:** Both triggers produce the same observable outcome (1h→5m TTL switch) via the same API fields. The simplest explanation is a single server-side "1h TTL eligibility" check with multiple disqualifying conditions (no telemetry, quota exceeded, possibly others).

**Caveats:** Trigger A is n=1; could be intentional design. Trigger B is observational (correlation); "stuck after reset" claim is second-hand.

### P3 — "Output Efficiency" System Prompt Change (v2.1.64, March 3)

**Source:** [Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts) — version-tracked CC system prompt diffs

v2.1.64 (2026-03-03) added an "Output efficiency" section to the default system prompt (+1,291 tokens):
> *"IMPORTANT: Go straight to the point. Try the simplest approach first without going in circles. Do not overdo it. Be extra concise."*

This correlates with the regression timeline. Multiple users report the model taking shortcuts, applying "simplest fixes," and ignoring deeper analysis — behaviors consistent with following this instruction literally. v2.1.63 (pre-change) is independently confirmed as producing better results by 4+ users (@wpank, @janstenpickle, @diabelko, @breno-ribeiro706).

**Caveat:** The regression was reported "starting in February" by some users, predating this March 3 change. This is likely an **aggravating factor**, not the sole root cause. Multiple overlapping changes (adaptive thinking bug, thinking redaction rollout) complicate attribution.

**Update (April 13, self-verified):** The "Output efficiency" section is **no longer present** in sessions after April 10, based on a scan of **353 local JSONL session files** for the exact text strings ("straight to the point", "do not overdo"). The last session containing this text was on April 9; all ~30 sessions from April 10 onward show zero occurrences. The transition boundary on April 8-9 is mixed (5 sessions PRESENT, ~20 ABSENT on April 9 alone), likely due to running multiple CC versions concurrently (claudeGt pinned at v2.1.91 vs auto-updated stock). The exact removal version cannot be pinpointed — v2.1.99 and v2.1.100 do not exist in the public changelog, and neither v2.1.98 nor v2.1.101 mentions this change (system prompt changes are typically not documented). The removal was first noted by [@wjordan](https://github.com/wjordan) (`author_association: NONE`, external observer tracking system prompts via [Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts)).

**Status change:** PRELIMINARY → **OBSERVED REMOVED** (between v2.1.98 and v2.1.101). Not officially confirmed by Anthropic. The removal suggests internal recognition that the section was problematic.

### P4 — Third-Party App Detection Gap (billing routing)

**GitHub Issue:** [#45380](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/45380)

Raw Anthropic SDK calls with OAuth tokens bypass third-party detection and bill to plan allowance instead of extra usage. HTTP header evidence shows `overage-utilization: 0.0` (zero extra usage) while `5h-utilization` increases. 42+ related misclassification issues confirm systemic detection problems in both directions (legitimate CC flagged as third-party, and third-party calls not detected).

**Caveat:** The "blocklist-based" mechanism is the most parsimonious explanation but not directly observed in source code.

## Measured Data

### Methodology

Transparent local monitoring proxy using [`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings#environment-variables) (official environment variable). The proxy logs `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` from each API response without modifying requests or responses (source-audited).

| Overall | ~20% | 86.4% | 86.2% | **88.4%** | **84.1%** |
| Verdict | **Avoid** | Good | Good | **Best** | **Good** |

v2.1.91 standalone cold start varies by workspace (27.8% in full benchmark vs 84.7% in single-prompt test), but recovery is dramatically faster than v2.1.90 (1 request vs 3-5). Both installations converge to 94-99% once warmed. ⚠️ Standalone sub-agent cold start regressed to 0% (full rebuild) in v2.1.91, down from 14-47% in v2.1.90 — npm is preferred for sub-agent-heavy workflows.

## Changelog Cross-Reference (v2.1.92–v2.1.101)

> **Added:** April 9, 2026 — systematic cross-reference of [official changelog](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) against all unfixed bugs. **Updated April 13** with v2.1.98 and v2.1.101 (v2.1.99 and v2.1.100 do not exist in the public changelog — version numbers were skipped).

Eight releases shipped between v2.1.91 (our last benchmark) and v2.1.101 (latest as of April 13). **None address the nine unfixed bugs.** v2.1.92–97 focused on Bedrock/authentication, UI polish, MCP improvements, and resume UX. v2.1.98 focused on security hardening (6+ Bash permission bypass fixes). v2.1.101 fixed several resume/MCP bugs tangential to but not addressing B3–B11.

| Bug | Changelog mentions (v2.1.92–97) | Verdict |
|-----|----------------------------------|---------|
| **B3** False RL | v2.1.94: "fixes 429 rate-limit handling"; v2.1.97: "exponential backoff" — both fix **server 429 response** handling, not the **client-side synthetic** rate limiter (zero API call, `model: "<synthetic>"`). Different code path entirely. | ❌ **UNFIXED** |
| **B4** Microcompact | No mention. Server-controlled via GrowthBook — client updates irrelevant. | ❌ **UNFIXED** |
| **B5** Budget Cap | v2.1.92: "Write tool diff 60% faster" — diff computation speed, not `applyToolResultBudget()`. 200K aggregate cap untouched. | ❌ **UNFIXED** |
| **B8** Log Duplication | v2.1.92: "Transcript accuracy: per-block entries carry final token usage instead of streaming placeholder" — may reduce PRELIM entries in **UI transcript**, but JSONL session file behavior unconfirmed. Needs v2.1.92+ JSONL verification. | ⚠️ **POSSIBLY PARTIAL** |
| **B8a** JSONL Corruption | No mention of atomic writes, fsync, or concurrent tool write safety. | ❌ **UNFIXED** |
| **B9** /branch Inflation | No mention. | ❌ **UNFIXED** |
| **B10** TaskOutput Thrash | No fix. TaskOutput deprecation message **still present** in v2.1.97 system prompt, continuing to trigger 21x context injection. Arguably **worsened** — the deprecation is now more prominently embedded. | ❌ **UNFIXED** |
| **B11** Zero Reasoning | v2.1.94: default effort medium→**high** (more thinking budget); v2.1.92: "400 error when extended thinking produced whitespace-only text" fixed (crash prevention). Root cause (zero-allocation by adaptive thinking) **not addressed** — bcherny stated "investigating with model team" on HN (April 6) with no follow-up. | ⚠️ **SYMPTOMS REDUCED** |
| **B2a** SendMessage Cache | v2.1.97: "resume-mode issues fixed (picker, diff)" — different symptoms. No mention of Agent SDK `SendMessage` cache miss (`cache_read=0`). | ❓ **UNCLEAR** |

**v2.1.98–v2.1.101 (added April 13):**

| Bug | Changelog mentions (v2.1.98–101) | Verdict |
|-----|-----------------------------------|---------|
| **B3** False RL | v2.1.98: "429 retries burning all attempts in ~13s — exponential backoff now applies as a minimum" — server 429 retry pacing, not client-side synthetic blocker. | ❌ **UNFIXED** |
| **B4** Microcompact | No mention. Server-controlled. | ❌ **UNFIXED** |
| **B5** Budget Cap | v2.1.101: "Fixed MCP tools with `_meta[\"anthropic/maxResultSizeChars\"]` not bypassing the token-based persist layer" — MCP-only fix for a feature added in v2.1.91. Does **not** affect built-in tool budget (`applyToolResultBudget()` 200K cap unchanged). | ❌ **UNFIXED** |
| **B8** Log Duplication | No mention. | ❌ **UNFIXED** |
| **B8a** JSONL Corruption | v2.1.101: "Fixed crash when persisted Edit/Write tool result was missing `file_path`" — crash prevention for a downstream symptom, not the root cause (non-atomic concurrent writes). | ❌ **UNFIXED** |
| **B9** /branch Inflation | v2.1.101: "Fixed a memory leak where long sessions retained dozens of historical copies of the message list in the virtual scroller" — UI memory leak, not message-history duplication in the API payload. Different layer. | ❌ **UNFIXED** |
| **B10** TaskOutput Thrash | No mention. Deprecation message still present. | ❌ **UNFIXED** |
| **B11** Zero Reasoning | No new progress beyond v2.1.94 effort default change. | ⚠️ **SYMPTOMS REDUCED** (unchanged) |
| **B2a** SendMessage Cache | v2.1.101: "Fixed `--resume`/`--continue` losing conversation context on large sessions" and "Fixed `--resume` cache misses for sessions with deferred tools, MCP servers, or custom agents" — these fix **CLI resume** code paths. Whether the **Agent SDK `SendMessage` orchestrator** (B2a's distinct code path) is also fixed is **unconfirmed**. | ❓ **POSSIBLY FIXED** (was UNCLEAR) |

**Preliminary findings (P1–P4):**

| Finding | Changelog mentions (v2.1.92–101) | Verdict |
|---------|----------------------------------|---------|
| **P1** Telemetry-TTL | None. `has repro` label on #45381 but no fix announced. | ❓ Unknown |
| **P2** TTL Dual Tiers | None. Server-side — would not appear in client changelog. | ❓ Unknown |
| **P3** "Output Efficiency" prompt | Self-verified: 353 JSONL sessions scanned, text absent in all sessions after April 10. See [P3 update above](#p3--output-efficiency-system-prompt-change-v2164-march-3). | 🔄 **OBSERVED REMOVED** |
| **P4** Third-Party Detection | None. Server-side billing routing. | ❓ Unknown |

**Summary:** Anthropic shipped 8 releases over 12 days (v2.1.92–101) with zero fixes for any of the nine unfixed bugs. v2.1.98 focused on security hardening (6+ Bash permission bypass fixes). v2.1.101 fixed several resume/MCP bugs tangential to but not addressing B3–B11. B2a status upgraded from UNCLEAR to POSSIBLY FIXED based on v2.1.101 resume improvements, pending Agent SDK verification. P3 ("Output efficiency" prompt) observed removed between v2.1.98 and v2.1.101 (self-verified via JSONL scan).
