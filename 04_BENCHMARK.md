# Cache Efficiency Benchmark — npm vs Standalone

> **Current answer (v2.1.91):** On v2.1.91, npm hits 84.5% cold start. Standalone varies by workspace (27.8% in the full benchmark, higher in single-prompt tests), but recovery is dramatically faster than v2.1.90 — both converge to 94-99% within a few requests. Use whichever you prefer.

## Environment

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Machine** | Linux workstation (ubuntu-1, x86-64) |
| **Plan** | Max 20 ($200/mo) |
| **Version** | v2.1.90 (both npm and standalone) |
| **Proxy** | cc-relay (transparent pass-through, logging only) |
| **Monitoring** | `cc-relay watch` + `cc-relay stats` + `cc-relay recent` |

### Installation Paths

| Alias | Path | Binary Type |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `claude-npm` | `~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.1/bin/claude` → `cli.js` | **Node.js** (symlink to npm module) |
| `claude` | `~/.local/bin/claude` → `~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.90` | **ELF 64-bit** (standalone binary) |

Both routed through `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080` (cc-relay proxy). Proxy source code confirmed **zero request/response modification** — only usage logging.

## Test Design

### npm Session — Scenarios

| # | Scenario | Purpose |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | Simple greeting ("현재 시간 알려줘") | Baseline — CLAUDE.md + MEMORY.md cold load |
| 2 | Single file read + summarize (markgrab README) | Read tool 1x, minimal context |
| 3 | Multi-file code exploration (feedkit entry point + 3 classes) | Glob + Read multiple, context accumulation |
| 4 | Follow-up on previous context (feedkit error handling) | Cache reuse test — prior turn context |
| 5 | Parallel comparison (markgrab vs feedkit dependencies) | Sub-agent potential, multi-project |
| 6 | Full project status read (12+ memory files) | Heavy read, broad context |
| 7 | **79 analysis reports** — 3 parallel sub-agents | Maximum load: 3 agents, 79 files, full summarization |

### Standalone Binary Session — Scenarios

| # | Scenario | Purpose |
|---|----------|---------|
| A | Large codebase exploration (forge pipeline) | New context forced — not in prior session |
| B | Multi-project architecture comparison (markgrab vs browsegrab) | Multi-file read, context growth |
| C | 5-turn sequential follow-up (feedkit deep dive) | Cache reuse across consecutive turns |
| D | 3-project parallel sub-agents (embgrep vs diffgrab vs snapgrab) | Maximum sub-agent load |

## v2.1.89 Baseline — The Broken State (April 1, JSONL data)

Before setting up the monitoring proxy, cache data was extracted from session JSONL files. These sessions show the drain that triggered the investigation:

| Session | Time | Entries | Avg Cache Read | Min | Max | Status |
|---------|------|---------|---------------|-----|-----|--------|
| `64d42269` | 4/1 16:33 | 233 | **47.0%** | 8.3% | 99.8% | Drain starting |
| `9100c2d2` | 4/1 18:04 | 89 | **36.1%** | 21.1% | 89.5% | **Worst drain — this triggered the investigation** |

After downgrading to v2.1.68 (npm):

| Session | Time | Entries | Avg Cache Read | Min | Max | Status |
|---------|------|---------|---------------|-----|-----|--------|
| `892388f6` | 4/1 19:12 | 119 | **97.6%** | 60.9% | 99.9% | **Recovered after downgrade** |

The 36.1% → 97.6% improvement after downgrading from v2.1.89 to v2.1.68 confirmed the regression was version-specific. Proxy monitoring was set up at 17:55 on April 1 to capture per-request data going forward.

## Comparison

### Overall

| Metric | npm (Node.js) | Standalone (ELF) |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Version | v2.1.90 | v2.1.90 |
| Scenarios completed | 1-7 (incl. 79-report parallel read) | A-D (forge, browsegrab, feedkit 5-turn, 3-project parallel) |
| **Usage consumed** | 28% → 35% (**7%**) | 35% → 40% (**5%**) |
| Overall cache read % | **86.4%** | **86.2%** |
| Sub-agent cold start cache % | **79-87%** | **47-67%** |
| Sub-agent warmed cache % | 87-94% | **94-99%** |
| Stable session cache % | 95-99.8% | **95-99.7%** |

### Sub-Agent Cache Behavior (Key Difference)

Both installations are identical v2.1.90, yet sub-agent context initialization shows different cache efficiency. The gap narrows as sub-agents warm up:

| Sub-Agent Phase | npm Read % | Standalone Read % | Delta |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Cold start (first 1-2 requests) | 63.5-80% | **14.6-47.2%** | **-16 to -66pp** |
| Warming (3-5 requests) | 79-87% | 67-88% | -0 to -20pp |
| Warmed (5+ requests) | 87-94% | **94-99%** | **~0pp or better** |
| Stable main session | 97-99.8% | **95-99.7%** | **~0pp** |

### Key Finding: v2.1.90 Standalone Dramatically Improved vs v2.1.89

| Metric | v2.1.89 Standalone | v2.1.90 Standalone | v2.1.90 npm |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Sub-agent cold start | **4-34%** | **14-47%** | **63-87%** |
| Sub-agent warmed | N/A (never recovered) | **94-99%** | **87-94%** |
| Stable session | 90-99% | **95-99.7%** | 95-99.8% |
| Overall efficiency | Poor — rapid drain | **Good** | **Optimal** |
| Usage for full test suite | 100% in ~70 min | **5% for scenarios A-D** | **7% for scenarios 1-7** |

**v2.1.90 standalone is a major improvement.** The Sentinel bug's impact is now limited to sub-agent cold starts (first 1-2 requests). Once warmed, standalone achieves **94-99% cache read — matching or exceeding npm's warming phase.** The critical difference from v2.1.89 is that v2.1.90 **recovers** from initial cache misses, while v2.1.89 never did.

### Token Cost Implication (Updated with Full Data)

Total usage across both sessions: **28% → 40% = 12% of Max 20 plan** for:
- 7 npm scenarios (including 79 analysis reports via 3 parallel agents)
- 4 standalone scenarios (forge exploration, architecture comparison, 5-turn sequential, 3-project parallel agents)

| Metric | npm | Standalone (v2.1.90) | Standalone (v2.1.89) |
|--------|-----|---------------------|---------------------|
| Sub-agent cold start cost | Low | Moderate (2-3x on first 1-2 requests) | Severe (10-20x sustained) |
| Sub-agent warmed cost | ~1x | **~1x** | N/A (never warms) |
| Effective session cost | 1x | **~1.1-1.3x** | **~3-4x** |
| Practical impact | Optimal | **Acceptable for all workflows** | Avoid |

v2.1.90 standalone's overhead is now marginal — limited to the first 1-2 sub-agent requests before cache warms up. For most real-world usage, the difference between npm and standalone v2.1.90 is negligible.

### Operational Note: Parallel Agents vs Parallel Terminals

This benchmark was conducted with **parallel agents within a single terminal** (recommended). This is different from running multiple terminal sessions simultaneously:

| Pattern | Cache Behavior | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Single terminal, parallel agents | Agents share billing context, main session cache intact | **Safe** |
| Multiple terminals simultaneously | Each terminal = independent session, no cache sharing, parallel quota drain | **Use with caution** |

Parallel agents within one session benefit from the main session's warmed cache. Multiple terminals each start cold and compete for the same rate limit pool.

---

## Why the Difference?

### Sentinel Bug (Bug 1) — Partially Mitigated in v2.1.90, Not Fully Resolved

The standalone binary ships as an ELF executable built with a custom Bun fork. This fork contains a `cch=00000` sentinel replacement mechanism that can corrupt cache prefixes under certain conditions.

**Evidence from this benchmark:**
- Same version (v2.1.90), same machine, same proxy, same API key
- Only variable: binary type (ELF vs Node.js)
- Main session cache is **nearly identical** (~95-99%) — both installations perform equally in stable conversation
- Sub-agent cold starts still show a gap (47% vs 80%), but v2.1.90 is significantly better than v2.1.89 (47% vs 14%)
- The gap closes as sub-agents warm up (72-88% after a few requests)

**Interpretation:** Anthropic has partially addressed the Sentinel bug in v2.1.90. The cache prefix corruption is less severe — it no longer produces catastrophic 4-17% read ratios on every sub-agent turn. However, fresh context initialization still performs ~20-30pp worse than the npm version, suggesting the underlying mechanism is still present but attenuated.

### Official Changelog Correlation

The [v2.1.89-90 changelog](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog) confirms multiple cache-related fixes that align with our benchmark observations:

**v2.1.89:**
- *"Fixed prompt cache misses in long sessions caused by tool schema bytes changing mid-session"* — directly addresses cache key instability
- *"Fixed StructuredOutput schema cache bug causing ~50% failure rate when using multiple schemas"*
- *"Fixed autocompact thrash loop"* — stops infinite compaction draining tokens
- *"Fixed memory leak where large JSON inputs were retained as LRU cache keys"*
- *"Fixed nested CLAUDE.md files being re-injected dozens of times"*

**v2.1.90:**
- *"Fixed --resume causing a full prompt-cache miss on the first request for users with deferred tools, MCP servers, or custom agents (regression since v2.1.69)"* — **Bug 2 official fix**
- *"Improved performance: eliminated per-turn JSON.stringify of MCP tool schemas on cache-key lookup"* — stabilizes cache keys across turns
- *"Fixed infinite loop where rate-limit options dialog would repeatedly auto-open"*

**Anthropic staff acknowledgment (via X, not GitHub):**
- Lydia Hallie (Product): *"We shipped some fixes on the Claude Code side that should help"* — [Post](https://x.com/lydiahallie/status/2039107775314428189)
- Thariq Shihipar (Technical Staff): Confirmed prompt caching bugs being investigated — [Post](https://x.com/trq212/status/2027232172810416493)

Note: Anthropic has not responded to any of the 91+ GitHub issues (2+ months of silence). All communication has been via personal X accounts and the changelog.

### Proxy Ruled Out

cc-relay source code audited: pure pass-through. No request/response body modification. Only reads `usage` metadata from responses for logging. The cache behavior difference is entirely between the Claude Code binary and the Anthropic API server.

## Recommendation

| Use Case | v2.1.90 npm | v2.1.90 Standalone | v2.1.89 Standalone |
|----------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| General coding (few sub-agents) | **Best** | **Good** | Avoid |
| Heavy sub-agent workloads | **Best** | **Good** (cold start overhead only) | Avoid (3-4x sustained) |
| Parallel agent research/analysis | **Best** | **Good** (agents warm up quickly) | Avoid |
| Maximum token efficiency | **Best** | **Close to optimal** | Avoid |

On v2.1.90, the gap with npm was limited to sub-agent cold starts (14-47%), recovering to 94-99% after 3-5 requests. Both consumed comparable quota (7% npm vs 5% standalone). v2.1.89 and earlier were the real problem — cache never recovered there. This gap was [fully closed in v2.1.91](#v2191-full-benchmark-april-3-2026).

### Disable Auto-Update First

**Critical:** Before testing, disable auto-update to prevent version drift during benchmarking — and keep it off until Anthropic confirms a full cache fix. A surprise update could reintroduce regressions.

```jsonc
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "env": {
    "DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER": "1"
  }
}
```

This applies to all Claude Code invocations (standalone, npm, patched) since they all read `~/.claude/settings.json`. npm installs have no auto-update mechanism regardless, but setting this ensures standalone binary stays pinned.

### Installation

```bash
# npm global install
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify it's Node.js based
file $(which claude)
# Should show: symbolic link to .../cli.js (NOT ELF executable)

# If standalone binary takes PATH priority, use alias:
alias claude-npm="~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.1/bin/claude"
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# Set up transparent proxy for cache monitoring
# Use ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL (official env var) to route through your proxy
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 claude
```

---

## Reproduction

To reproduce this benchmark:

1. Install both npm and standalone versions (they coexist at different paths)
2. Set up a transparent logging proxy using `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
3. Run identical workloads through each installation
4. Compare `cache_creation_input_tokens` vs `cache_read_input_tokens` in proxy logs
5. Focus on **sub-agent requests** — that's where the difference is most dramatic

The key insight: **stable main-session cache looks similar between both installations**. The bug primarily manifests during **fresh context creation** (sub-agents, new sessions, post-compaction). If you only test single-session chat, you may miss the difference entirely.

### Cross-Version Comparison (Full Scenarios)

| Metric | v2.1.90 npm | v2.1.90 standalone | v2.1.91 npm | v2.1.91 standalone |
|--------|------------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Scenarios | 7 (1-7) | 4 (A-D) | 7 (1-7) | 4 (A-D) |
| Requests | ~1,753* | ~200 | 34 | 30 |
| Overall cache | 86.4% | 86.2% | **88.4%** | **84.1%** |
| Cold start | 63.5-80% | **14.6-47.2%** | **84.5%** | **27.8%** |
| Cold start recovery | 3-5 reqs to 95%+ | 3-5 reqs to 94-99% | 2 reqs to 98%+ | **1 req to 99.3%** |
| Sub-agent cold | 54-80% | 14-47% | **54.1%** | **0%** (full rebuild) |
| Sub-agent stable | 87-94% | 94-99% | **93-99%** | **91-99%** |
| Stable session | 95-99.8% | 95-99.7% | **98-99.6%** | **94-99%** |

*\*v2.1.90 request counts include sub-agent turns (each sub-agent turn = one request in the proxy log), while v2.1.91 counts are main session requests only. The v2.1.90 npm session spawned many sub-agents for Scenario 7 (79-report parallel read), inflating its count.*

**Findings:**

1. **Standalone cold start varies**: v2.1.91 standalone showed 27.8% on first request in the full benchmark. A preliminary single-prompt test before this benchmark showed a higher cold start (~84.7%), but that test used a lighter workspace configuration and was not recorded in detail. The difference suggests initial context loading (CLAUDE.md, memory files, tool schemas) affects cold start depending on workspace size. npm showed a consistent 84.5%.

2. **Recovery is much faster on v2.1.91**: Standalone recovered from 27.8% to 99.3% in a single request. On v2.1.90, recovery from 14-47% took 3-5 requests.

3. **Sub-agent behavior**: npm sub-agents start at 54.1% and warm to 93%+. Standalone sub-agents start at 0% (full rebuild) but warm quickly to 91%+. The sub-agent gap still exists in v2.1.91 but is less impactful due to fast recovery.

4. **Overall efficiency**: Both installations achieve comparable overall cache (88.4% vs 84.1%). The 4pp difference is primarily from the standalone cold start — once warmed, they converge.

**Recommendation update:** On v2.1.91, **either installation is fine.** npm retains a theoretical advantage (no Sentinel code path) but the practical difference is now negligible. See [06_TEST-RESULTS-0403.md](06_TEST-RESULTS-0403.md) for full per-request data.
