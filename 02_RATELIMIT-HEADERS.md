## Summary

Anthropic's API returns `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` headers on every response. Claude Code reads only `representative-claim` for the usage bar and discards the rest. Our cc-relay proxy captures all of them. From 3,702 requests with headers (April 4–6), we identified a **dual sliding window** system — a 5-hour window and a 7-day window — and measured the per-1% utilization cost in tokens.

**Key findings:**
- The 5h window is always the bottleneck (`representative-claim` = `five_hour` in 100% of requests)
- Each 1% of 5h utilization costs roughly 1.5M–2.1M visible tokens (96–99% of which is cache_read)
- Visible output tokens per 1% are only 9K–16K — suggesting thinking tokens or cache-read weighting (or both) drive most of the quota cost
- The 7d counter accumulates proportionally to 5h usage (ratio ~0.12–0.17)
- 5h windows reset on roughly 5-hour intervals; 7d resets on a fixed weekly timestamp

## 1. Header Fields

Every API response includes these headers:

```
anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-utilization: 0.26
anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-reset: 1775455200
anthropic-ratelimit-unified-7d-utilization: 0.19
anthropic-ratelimit-unified-7d-reset: 1775973600
anthropic-ratelimit-unified-representative-claim: five_hour
anthropic-ratelimit-unified-fallback-percentage: 0.5
anthropic-ratelimit-unified-overage-status: allowed
anthropic-ratelimit-unified-overage-utilization: 0.0
```

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `5h-utilization` | Current 5-hour window usage (0.0 = empty, 1.0 = exhausted) |
| `5h-reset` | Unix timestamp when this 5h window ends and resets |
| `7d-utilization` | Current 7-day window usage |
| `7d-reset` | Unix timestamp when this 7d window ends and resets |
| `representative-claim` | Which window is the tighter constraint — this is what the CLI displays |
| `fallback-percentage` | Capacity allocation ratio (consistently 0.5) |
| `overage-status` | Extra-usage billing state |
| `overage-utilization` | Extra-usage budget consumed |

### Aggregate observations (n=3,702)

- `representative-claim` = `five_hour` in **100%** of requests
- `fallback-percentage` = `0.5` in 100% of requests
- `overage-utilization` = `0.0` throughout
- 5h reset timestamps observed: 14:00, 19:00, 01:00, 12:00, 18:00, 23:00, 04:00, 09:00 KST — mostly 5h apart, with two exceptions: 19:00→01:00 is 6h, and 01:00→12:00 is 11h (likely an unobserved window boundary during inactive hours). Exact boundary pattern needs more data.
- 7d reset: April 10, 12:00 KST (fixed weekly, consistent across all responses)

## 2. Per-Window Data

Windows split by `5h-reset` header value (when the reset timestamp changes, that's a new window):

| # | Window ends (KST) | Reqs | Peak 5h | 7d start→end | Σ Output | Σ Cache Read | Σ Input |
|---|-------------------|------|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|---------|
| A | 4/4 14:00 | 1,332 | **0.39** | 0.06→0.11 | 617,750 | 69,413,540 | 2,098,077 |
| B | 4/4 19:00 | 132 | 0.04 | 0.11→0.11 | 33,723 | 10,716,011 | 4,169 |
| C | 4/5 01:00 | 633 | 0.27 | 0.11→0.15 | 360,205 | 55,546,393 | 569,512 |
| D | 4/5 12:00 | 51 | 0.08 | 0.15→0.16 | 17,518 | 2,360,057 | 5,590 |
| E | 4/5 18:00 | 616 | 0.26 | 0.16→0.19 | 299,586 | 45,397,643 | 545,389 |
| F | 4/5 23:00 | 466 | 0.21 | 0.19→0.22 | 192,424 | 32,005,226 | 437,827 |
| G | 4/6 04:00 | 368 | 0.18 | 0.22→0.25 | 190,076 | 34,083,583 | 112,763 |
| H | 4/6 09:00 | 104 | 0.02 | 0.25→0.25 | 25,901 | 11,009,102 | 886 |

Windows B and H had minimal activity (peak 0.04 and 0.02) — excluded from per-1% analysis.

All data is post-fix (v2.1.91, April 4 onward) and unaffected by the v2.1.89 cache regression.

---

## 3. Cost per 1% of 5h Utilization

Total tokens divided by peak utilization in percentage points. "Total Visible" = Output + Cache Read + Input (all measured token types; thinking tokens excluded since they're not in the API response):

| Window | Peak | Output per 1% | Cache Read per 1% | Total Visible per 1% |
|--------|------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| A | 0.39 | 15,840 | 1,779,834 | 1,849,471 |
| C | 0.27 | 13,341 | 2,057,274 | 2,091,707 |
| E | 0.26 | 11,523 | 1,746,063 | 1,778,562 |
| F | 0.21 | 9,163 | 1,524,058 | 1,554,070 |
| G | 0.18 | 10,560 | 1,893,532 | 1,910,357 |

- Cache_read is 96–99% of visible tokens per utilization point
- Output per 1%: 9K–16K (variance ~1.73x)
- Cache Read per 1%: 1.5M–2.1M (variance ~1.35x)
- A full 5h window (100%) would correspond to only ~0.9M–1.6M visible output tokens

### Blind spot: thinking tokens

Extended thinking tokens are not included in `output_tokens` from the API. The actual per-1% cost is:

```
Visible output:    9K–16K       (measured)
Thinking output:   unknown      (not in API response)
Cache read:        1.5M–2.1M   (measured)
Input:             ~25K         (measured)
```

Cannot decompose cache-read weight vs thinking token contribution from client side.

## 4. 7d Accumulation Pattern

For windows with measurable 7d change (excluding B and H where 7d delta was 0.00). Note: Window D (peak 0.08) is included here despite being excluded from the per-1% table in Section 3 — the 7d accumulation is measurable even for light windows, while per-1% cost calculations become unreliable at very low peaks.

| Window | 5h Peak | 7d delta | Ratio (7d/5h) |
|--------|---------|----------|---------------|
| A | 0.39 | +0.05 | 0.128 |
| C | 0.27 | +0.04 | 0.148 |
| D | 0.08 | +0.01 | 0.125 |
| E | 0.26 | +0.03 | 0.115 |
| F | 0.21 | +0.03 | 0.143 |
| G | 0.18 | +0.03 | 0.167 |

Ratios cluster at 0.12–0.17. Directionally consistent but not precise — 7d values are 2-decimal, so +0.03 could be 0.025–0.035. Six data points is insufficient for a firm formula.

## 5. v2.1.89 Separation

The v2.1.89 cache regression (March 28 – April 1) is a **separate, resolved** issue from the capacity reduction. Clean comparison framework:

| Period | Cache health | Nature |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Mar 23–27 ("golden") | 98–99% | Clean baseline |
| Mar 28–Apr 1 (v2.1.89 bug) | 86%, 29% broken | Exclude from capacity analysis |
| Apr 2–5 (v2.1.91+) | 84–97%, 0% broken | Post-fix — capacity reduction visible |

All proxy data in this document is from the post-fix period.

---

## 6. Limitations

- **Plan-specific.** Max 20x ($200/mo) data. Per-1% costs likely differ on other tiers.
- **No before-data.** Proxy started April 4 — no March baseline for comparison.
- **48h / 8 windows.** Consistent trends but small sample size. Full 7-day cycle completes April 10.
- **5h boundary timing approximate.** Eight reset timestamps observed, not enough to confirm exact pattern.
- **Thinking token blind spot.** Cannot separate thinking token contribution from cache-read weighting.

## 7. Community Cross-References

### @fgrosswig — 64x Budget Reduction Forensics ([#38335](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/38335#issuecomment-4189537353))

- **Plan:** Max 5x ($100/mo), Opus 4.6 1M, dual-machine (Windows + Linux)
- **Method:** Parsed all local JSONL session logs across both machines, March 18 – April 5
- **Finding:** March 26 consumed 3.2B tokens (combined) with no limit hit; April 5 consumed 88M and hit 90% — ~64x effective budget reduction
- **Hypothesis:** Cache-read token weighting changed from ~0x to ~1x around March 23–28
- **Key data:** Per-day token tables, subagent cache analysis, hourly April 5 breakdown

### @Commandershadow9 — 34–143x Capacity Reduction ([#41506](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/41506#issuecomment-4189508296))

- **Plan:** Max $100/mo, Opus 4.6 1M, Debian 12, 15 plugins (reduced from 57), 9 MCP servers
- **Method:** Analyzed all local JSONL session transcripts, March 1 – April 5
- **Finding:** Cache fix confirmed (v2.1.91+), but 34–143x capacity reduction persists independent of cache bug
- **Hypothesis:** Thinking tokens now counted against quota at a different weight — invisible in local logs
- **Key data:** Golden period vs post-fix comparison, cross-tier table, plugin reduction test

### Relationship to our analysis

Both analyses measure **client-side token consumption** (what was sent/received). Our proxy data adds the **server-side utilization response** (how the server scored that consumption). Neither alone tells the full story — the combination gives both sides of the equation.

---

## 8. Next Steps

- **April 10:** Full 7-day cycle completes — publish comprehensive weekly analysis
- **Thinking token isolation test:** Run sessions with thinking disabled and compare per-1% cost
- **Cross-tier comparison:** If community members on other plan tiers run proxies, we can compare per-1% costs across plans
