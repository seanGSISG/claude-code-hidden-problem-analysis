---

## Phase 4 — Silent Quota Reduction + Mass Revolt (2025-09 ~ 2025-10)

Anthropic silently reduced weekly limits server-side. First major trust breach.

| Date | Issue | Title | Comments | Reactions |
|------|-------|-------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-10-07 | [#9094](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9094) | **[Meta] Unexpected change in Claude usage limits as of 2025-09-29** (30+ reports) | **121** | 60 |

**Key facts:**
- Pro users: weekly usable hours dropped from 40-50h → 6-8h
- All tiers affected (Pro, Max 5x, Max 20x)
- "Bait and switch" accusations
- Subscription cancellations + competitor migration reported

Server-side quota problems + client-side bugs compound.

| Date | Issue | Title | Comments | Key Finding |
|------|-------|-------|----------|-------------|
| 2025-11-01 | [#10784](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10784) | OAuth expiration causes retry storm consuming 100% session usage (3.75M wasted tokens) | 7 | **OAuth retry storm: 3.75M tokens wasted** |

**Key facts:**
- Max subscribers hitting limit immediately after reset
- Usage meter at 84% but "limit reached" — internal accounting mismatch
- #16157 became the mega-thread for all rate limit complaints

---

## Phase 7 — Opus 4.6 + Second Explosion (2026-02)

Silent auto-upgrade to Opus 4.6 + higher token consumption + compaction bugs.

| Date | Issue | Title | Comments | Reactions |

### New Root Causes Discovered (April 2-3)

Two significant discoveries by community investigation:

**Bug 3 — Client-side false rate limiter** ([#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584), discovered by [@rwp65](https://github.com/rwp65)):
Local rate limiter generates synthetic "Rate limit reached" errors (`model: "<synthetic>"`, `input_tokens: 0`) without calling the API. Triggered by large transcripts + concurrent sub-agents. Cross-referenced by [@marlvinvu](https://github.com/marlvinvu) across [#40438](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40438), [#39938](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/39938), [#38239](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/38239). **Unfixed in v2.1.90.**

**Bug 4 — Silent microcompact → cache invalidation** ([#42542](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42542), discovered by [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th)):
Three compaction mechanisms (`microCompact.ts:422`, `microCompact.ts:305`, `sessionMemoryCompact.ts:57`) silently strip tool results on every API call, controlled by server-side GrowthBook A/B flags. Proxy testing (April 3) showed **cache ratio stays 99%+ in main sessions** during clearing — the stable substitution preserves the prompt prefix. The actual cost is **context quality degradation** (model loses access to earlier tool results). Also explains why old Docker versions started draining recently ([#37394](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/37394)) — server-side flags changed without client update. **Unfixed through v2.1.91, server-controlled.**

**Bug 5 — Tool result budget enforcement** (discovered by [@Sn3th](https://github.com/Sn3th), confirmed by proxy April 3):
`applyToolResultBudget()` runs before microcompact in the request pipeline, enforcing a 200K aggregate cap on tool results via `tengu_hawthorn_window` GrowthBook flag. Per-tool caps (Grep 20K, Bash 30K) via `tengu_pewter_kestrel`. 261 budget events measured in one session — tool results truncated to 1-41 chars. v2.1.91 `maxResultSizeChars` override is MCP-only. **Unfixed for built-in tools.**

**Server-side 1M billing regression** ([#42616](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42616), [#42569](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42569)):
Max plan 1M context (free since March 13) incorrectly classified as "extra usage." Debug log shows 429 at 23K tokens with request ID `req_011CZf8TJf84hAUziB6LuRoc`. **Server-side bug, unfixed.**

### Official Fixes Shipped (v2.1.89-90, April 1)

Anthropic shipped cache-related fixes in v2.1.89-90 without any GitHub issue response. Fixes were confirmed via [changelog](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog) and personal X posts from Anthropic staff.

| Version | Fix | Addresses |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| v2.1.89 | Prompt cache misses from tool schema bytes changing mid-session | Bug 1 (partial) |
| v2.1.89 | StructuredOutput schema cache bug (~50% failure rate) | Cache stability |
| v2.1.89 | Autocompact thrash loop detection + stop | Token drain loop |
| v2.1.89 | Memory leak in LRU cache keys | Long session stability |
| v2.1.89 | Nested CLAUDE.md re-injection (dozens of times) | Context bloat |
| v2.1.90 | **`--resume` full prompt-cache miss (regression since v2.1.69)** | **Bug 2 (official fix)** |
| v2.1.90 | **Per-turn JSON.stringify of MCP tool schemas eliminated** | Cache key stability |
| v2.1.90 | Rate-limit options dialog infinite loop | Session crash |
| v2.1.90 | SSE large frame quadratic → linear | Performance |

**v2.1.91 (April 2-3):**

| Version | Fix | Addresses |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| v2.1.91 | `_meta["anthropic/maxResultSizeChars"]` up to 500K | Bug 10 — **MCP-only workaround** (built-in tools unaffected) |
| v2.1.91 | `--resume` transcript chain break fix | Bug 2 (additional fix) |
| v2.1.91 | Edit tool shorter `old_string` anchors | Output token reduction |

**Staff response (April 2-3):**
- [Lydia Hallie](https://x.com/lydiahallie/status/2039800715607187906) (thread): *"Peak-hour limits are tighter and 1M-context sessions got bigger, that's most of what you're feeling. We fixed a few bugs along the way, but none were over-charging you."* Community reaction was strongly negative — measured data from multiple independent investigators shows additional unfixed bugs (see [analysis repo](https://github.com/ArkNill/claude-code-cache-analysis)).
- [Lydia Hallie](https://x.com/lydiahallie/status/2039107775314428189) (earlier): *"We shipped some fixes on the Claude Code side that should help"*
- [Thariq Shihipar](https://x.com/trq212/status/2027232172810416493): Confirmed prompt caching bugs being investigated (earlier incident)

**Independent verification:** Controlled benchmarks confirm v2.1.90-91 achieve 82-86% overall cache read and 95-99% in stable sessions. v2.1.91 closes the npm/standalone gap (84.7% identical cold start). See [BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md).

## Identified Root Causes

These are compound — multiple bugs interact to produce the observed behavior.

### Client-Side Bugs

| # | Root Cause | Issue | Version | Impact |
|---|-----------|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | **Cache sentinel replacement** — standalone binary's Bun fork breaks cache prefix | [#40524](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40524) | All standalone | Full cache rebuild every turn. **Partially fixed in v2.1.89-90** ([changelog](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog)) |
| 2 | **Resume cache regression** — `deferred_tools_delta` mismatch invalidates cache on resume | [#34629](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/34629) | v2.1.69+ | **20x cost increase** (measured). **Fixed in v2.1.90** ([changelog](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog)) |
| 3 | **Compaction infinite loop** — 211 consecutive compactions with zero progress | [#24179](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/24179) | v2.1.x | Entire budget consumed. **Thrash loop fixed in v2.1.89** |
| 4 | **OAuth retry storm** — token expiration triggers retry cascade | [#10784](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10784) | — | 3.75M tokens wasted |
| 5 | **MCP tool description overhead** — loaded on every message | [#3406](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/3406) | All | 10-20K tokens/message |
| 6 | **Memory file double-load** — in git worktrees | [#24283](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/24283) | — | Premature compaction |
| 7 | **Thinking signature replay** — opaque base64 blocks resent on resume | [#42260](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42260) | — | 500K+ tokens per resume |
| 8 | **Client-side false rate limiter** — synthetic error blocks requests without API call | [#40584](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40584) | All | Instant "Rate limit reached" with `model: "<synthetic>"`, `input_tokens: 0`. **Unfixed** |
| 9 | **Silent microcompact → context degradation** — GrowthBook-controlled compaction strips tool results | [#42542](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42542) | v2.1.89+ | Context quality loss (cache stays 99%+ in main session). **Unfixed, server-controlled** |
| 10 | **Tool result budget enforcement** — `applyToolResultBudget()` caps tool results at 200K aggregate | GrowthBook flags | All | Tool results truncated to 1-41 chars after threshold. **Unfixed** (v2.1.91 MCP override only) |
| 11 | **JSONL log duplication** — extended thinking generates 2-5x PRELIM entries per API call | [#41346](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/41346) | All | 2.87x token inflation in local logs. Server impact unknown. **Unfixed** |

### Server-Side Issues

| # | Root Cause | Evidence | Impact |
|---|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Silent quota reduction** — weekly/5h limits reduced without notice | [#9094](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9094), [#28848](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/28848) | 5-8x reduction in usable hours |
| 2 | **Accounting mismatch** — meter shows 16-84% but "limit reached" | [#19673](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/19673), [#29579](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/29579) | Unpredictable cutoffs |
| 3 | **Org-level quota sharing** — accounts under same org share pool (`organizationUuid` keying) | Source code analysis | Unexpected cross-account drain |
| 4 | **Opus 4.6 auto-upgrade** — higher token consumption, no opt-out | [#23706](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/23706) | Higher base cost per turn |
| 5 | **Server-side accounting change** — old Docker versions drain fast without client update | [#37394](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/37394) | Proves server-side cause independent of client bugs |
| 6 | **1M context billing regression** — Max plan 1M requests classified as "extra usage" | [#42616](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42616), [#42569](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42569) | Spurious 429 at 23K tokens, incorrect billing |
