## Anthropic Official Response

**GitHub:** Zero responses across 91+ rate-limit issues (2+ months of silence).

**April 2, 2026 — Lydia Hallie (Anthropic, Product) posted on X:**

> *"Peak-hour limits are tighter and 1M-context sessions got bigger, that's most of what you're feeling. We fixed a few bugs along the way, but none were over-charging you."*

**Our measured data raises questions about this assessment:**
- **Bug 5 (200K cap):** Tool results silently truncated to 1-41 chars after the aggregate 200K threshold. Users paying for 1M context effectively have a 200K tool result budget for built-in tools — the rest is silently discarded.
- **Bug 3 (synthetic RL):** 151 `<synthetic>` entries across 65 sessions on our setup alone. The client blocks API calls without server involvement — users see "Rate limit reached" with zero actual API consumption.
- **Bug 8 (PRELIM duplication):** Extended thinking sessions log 2-3x more token entries than actual API calls. Whether the server-side rate limiter counts these remains an open question.

### Related Session Loading Analysis

[@kolkov](https://github.com/kolkov) independently analyzed v2.1.91 `--resume` regressions at the **JSONL DAG / session loading layer** — a different level from the API-level cache bugs.

**Issue:** [anthropics/claude-code#43044](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/43044)

| # | Regression | Effect |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | `walkChainBeforeParse` removed | Fork pruning gone for JSONL files >5MB |
| 2 | `ExY` timestamp fallback bridges fork boundaries | Forks merged across timestamp boundaries |
| 3 | Missing `leafUuids` check | Last-session detection picks wrong log file |

**Tool:** [ccdiag](https://github.com/kolkov/ccdiag). This covers the **pre-API pipeline** (how JSONL logs are reconstructed), distinct from the API-level analysis in this repo.
